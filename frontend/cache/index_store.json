It \r\ndoes not create or confer any rights on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You \r\ncan use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify \r\nthe appropriate staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance. I. Introduction \r\n \r\nThis guidance provides guidance on advisory committee voting procedures and is \r\nintended for use by FDA advisory committee members and FDA staff involved with \r\nadvisory committee matters. This document  recommends  uniform  procedures that can \r\nbe used for the voting process when votes are taken during advisory committee meetings. This document does not recommend when votes should be taken. FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally \r\nenforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking \r\non a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or \r\nstatutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means \r\nthat something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. Background \r\n \r\nFDA's advisory committees provide  independent expert advice to the agency on a \r\nrange of complex scientific,  technical, and policy issues, including questions related to \r\nthe development and evaluation of products regulated by FDA. Advisory committees are \r\na valuable resource to FDA, and they make an important contribution to the agency’s \r\ndecision-making processes. Although advisory committees provide recommendations to \r\nFDA, FDA makes the final decisions. 3",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\n \r\n \r\nAdvisory committees typically communicate advice or recommendations to the \r\nagency in two ways. First, FDA learns from the discussion and exchange that occurs \r\namong advisory committee members, and from individual recommendations and \r\nsuggestions made during the discussion of any advisory committee meeting. Second, \r\nadvisory committees often vote on a question or series of questions posed to the \r\ncommittee during a committee meeting. As the agency makes its final decision, FDA \r\nseriously considers the recommendations made by advisory committees, including the \r\nadvisory committee deliberations and voting. This document provides guidance on the procedures used for voting. There are some advisory committee meetings at which votes are not taken. For \r\nexample, votes are typically not taken at meetings to discuss the development of a \r\nclinical trial design or the development of a guidance document. At other  advisory committee meetings, members cast a formal vote on issues related \r\nto the approvability of a product submission. In others, different questions may be posed \r\nto a committee for a formal vote. Votes can be an effective means of communicating \r\nwith FDA because they provide feedback on discrete questions. These questions are \r\ngenerally scientific in nature and can involve a range of subjects, including evaluation of \r\npost-market safety data or pre-market assessment of a product's risk/benefit profile. Since all members vote on the same question, the results help FDA gauge a committee’s \r\ncollective view on complex, multi-faceted issues. FDA recognizes that many of the \r\nquestions voted on by advisory committee members are complex and that the discussion \r\nthat accompanies the voting is important.. The discussion, together with the votes, helps \r\ninform the agency’s own deliberations on scientific and regulatory matters. Accordingly, FDA recommends adopting uniform voting procedures to help \r\nmaximize the integrity and meaning of voting results. In developing these \r\nrecommendations, FDA is mindful of the legal requirements of the Federal Advisory \r\nCommittee Act (FACA), other relevant statutes (e.g., the Federal Food, Drug, and \r\nCosmetic Act), regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 14), guidance, policies, and the goals of \r\nFDA’s advisory committee program. Transparency and public participation are critical features of the advisory committee \r\nprocess. The use of secret ballots, long a hallmark of the American electoral experience, \r\ngenerally is not appropriate in the advisory committee context because the expert opinion \r\nof each member should be clearly understood and identified with that expert. Nevertheless, even with public balloting, the voting process can be managed to help \r\nmaximize the integrity and utility of the outcome. There has been much discussion inside and outside FDA regarding sequential versus \r\nsimultaneous voting. Some have expressed concern that sequential voting, in which \r\nmembers cast public votes in turn, has the potential to compromise the integrity of the \r\nresult. 4",

This potential risk may be aggravated in the advisory \r\ncommittee setting, where votes are often conducted in full view of a passionate public \r\nand participatory audience. In the case of sequential voting, there is also a potential risk \r\nthat comments made by a committee member or a designated federal officer (DFO) \r\nduring the vote could inappropriately affect the deliberations of those who have not yet \r\nvoted. Another potential risk is that comments could alter the meaning (or interpretation) \r\nof the question at issue in such a way as to cast doubt on whether all the members voted \r\non the identical question. III. Policy \r\n \r\nAccordingly, to help maximize the integrity, consistency, and utility of advisory \r\ncommittee voting results, FDA recommends that the voting process include the following \r\nprocedures:   \r\n \r\n• The Chair and DFO of an advisory committee are encouraged to generate a robust \r\ndiscussion about the matter at issue before any voting takes place. As part of this \r\nprocess, the Chair or DFO should encourage the non-voting members to \r\nparticipate in the discussion and should solicit the views of all members so that \r\nany comment, insight, or concern that could influence a voter’s conclusions on the \r\nmatter at issue is heard and considered before a vote related to that matter occurs, \r\nnot afterward. The Chair or DFO should also consider in advance of the vote the \r\nneed for the advisory committee members to have an opportunity following the \r\nvote to further explain any important qualifications related to their votes. • The question presented for a vote should have minimal qualifiers, not be leading, \r\nand should avoid the use of double or triple negatives. When presenting a \r\nquestion for a vote, the Chair, DFO, or other senior agency officials should solicit \r\nand answer questions about its meaning before the vote begins. The objective is \r\nto reduce any potential confusion and maximize the meaning of the voting results \r\nby ensuring that the votes are based on a consistent and collective understanding \r\nof the question at issue. • Voting should be done simultaneously. The objective is to avoid any potential \r\norder bias associated with sequential voting and thereby enhance the integrity and \r\nmeaning of the voting results. The committee Chair or DFO has discretion to \r\ndecide the precise method of voting on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Examples \r\n \r\n1   See, e.g., Callander, S. (2007):  “Bandwagons and Momentum in Sequential Voting,” Review of \r\nEconomic Studies, 74, 653-684; Banerjee, A.

The committee Chair or DFO should determine and announce the precise method  \r\nat the beginning of the meeting. Further, whatever method of voting is employed, \r\nthe names of the committee members and their respective votes should be read \r\naloud and otherwise made part of the public record shortly after the vote is taken. • The question put to the vote should not be the subject of further discussion or \r\nclarification while the voting is underway (i.e., whereas a discussion and \r\nclarification of the question is encouraged before the vote, there should be no \r\ndiscussion of the meaning of the question while members actually cast their \r\nsimultaneous votes). Once voting on a particular question has begun, that vote \r\ngenerally should not be terminated until the vote is complete. Following \r\ncompletion of the vote, consistent with the first bullet above, advisory committee \r\nmembers may explain their vote. Additional clarification of the question after a \r\nvote and a re-vote on a re-worded question may occur at the discretion of the \r\nDFO or committee chair. • In some instances, the Chair of an advisory committee may believe the committee \r\nshould vote on a related or relevant question not posed by FDA. If the Chair \r\nwants to put another question to a vote on his/her own initiative, the Chair should \r\nfirst check with the DFO or other senior FDA officials present to be sure that the \r\nquestion is appropriate for the meeting, that it is consistent with the topic \r\nidentified in the meeting notices, and that it will not affect the conflict-of-interest \r\nscreening that had been completed prior to the meeting. If a determination is made \r\nthat the question should be posed, the Chair should discuss the matter with the \r\ncommittee members before the voting begins to ensure that the committee \r\nmembers collectively understand the question and feel adequately prepared (either \r\nthrough the background materials or their own expertise) to render a \r\nmeaningful/informed vote on the new question. • Briefing materials provided to advisory committee members as background \r\nmaterials before an advisory committee meeting should be thorough and, to the \r\nextent possible, include the questions that will be voted upon by the committee. The objective is to maximize the meaning and utility of the voting results by \r\nensuring that the voters have had ample opportunity to study background \r\nmaterials before the day of the meeting.

It does not create nor confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate \r\nto bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the \r\nrequirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an \r\nalternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If \r\nyou cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the \r\ntitle page of this guidance. I. INTRODUCTION   \r\nThe Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) advisory committees play an essential \r\nrole in FDA’s activities to protect and promote public health through the regulation of \r\nhuman and animal drugs, biological products, medical devices, foods, and tobacco \r\nproducts. FDA’s advisory committees provide independent expert advice and \r\nrecommendations to the Agency on scientific, technical, and policy matters related to \r\nFDA-regulated products. Advisory committees enhance FDA’s ability to protect and \r\npromote public health by ensuring FDA has access to such advice through the public \r\nhearing process as provided in existing laws and regulations. Although advisory \r\ncommittees provide recommendations to FDA, FDA makes the final decisions on any \r\nmatters considered by an advisory committee. General procedures for FDA advisory \r\ncommittees are described at 21 CFR Part 14. 1 This guidance applies to all FDA advisory committees including the panels of the Medical Devices \r\nAdvisory Committee. This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Special Medical Programs in the \r\nOffice of the Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration.",

          "text": "2 \r\nFDA encourages participation from all public stakeholders in its decision-making \r\nprocesses. Every advisory committee meeting includes an open public hearing (OPH) \r\nsession, during which interested persons may present relevant information or views orally \r\nor in writing (21 CFR 14.25(a)). FDA’s regulation, 21 CFR 14.29, requires that a \r\nminimum of 60 minutes per meeting be dedicated to an OPH session for oral \r\npresentations, unless public participation does not last that long. For meetings that \r\nextend more than 1 day and/or meetings with multiple topics, the OPH session can be \r\ndivided into multiple parts. If there is an overwhelming interest by the advisory \r\ncommittee in a specific topic, then the committee chair2 may extend the OPH session. The time and location of the meeting and the OPH session is published in the Federal \r\nRegister (21 CFR 14.20) at least 15 days before a meeting. This guidance is intended to answer questions about how the public may participate \r\nat an OPH session. This includes, but is not limited to, general members of the public; \r\nindividuals or spokespersons from the regulated industry (except the sponsor whose \r\nproduct is under review); consumer advocacy groups; and professional organizations, \r\nsocieties, or associations. FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally \r\nenforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking \r\non a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or \r\nstatutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means \r\nthat something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 2 The chair is a committee member appointed to preside at committee meetings and ensure that all rules of \r\norder and conduct are maintained during each session (21 CFR 14.30). He or she is typically an \r\nexperienced committee member.",

FDA recommends that the Chair make a statement at the beginning of the \r\nOPH session encouraging committee members that it is appropriate to ask \r\nquestions of OPH speakers if doing so might lead to information that is helpful \r\nto the committee’s deliberations. The Chair should remind the public and \r\nmembers of the importance of the OPH session to the advisory committee \r\nprocess and that all speakers should be treated in a courteous and respectful \r\nmanner. 2. FDA generally will make available to speakers a podium or lapel microphone. 3. A timer is used to monitor each speaker. A visual signal (e.g., \r\ngreen/yellow/red light system), the Committee Chair, or the DFO should alert \r\nthe speaker when his or her allotted time has nearly expired. If the allotted \r\ntime ends before the speaker has concluded his or her presentation, the Chair \r\nor DFO should advise the speaker to complete his or her final remarks and \r\nconclude the presentation. In the event that the speaker chooses not to \r\nconclude the presentation after being asked to do so, the microphone may be \r\nturned off to end the presentation. 4. When the speaker’s presentation concludes, the Chair may ask the speaker to \r\nremain at the podium for questions from the advisory committee. 5. All oral statements are recorded in the transcript of the meeting. Meeting \r\ntranscripts are posted on the FDA web site approximately three to four weeks \r\nafter the meeting takes place. III.

Introduction \r\nThis document provides guidance for FDA staff regarding the release of final and, in some \r\ncircumstances, preliminary Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) laboratory analytical results to \r\nthe responsible party.2  This policy applies to samples collected during FDA regulatory activities \r\nand analyzed in ORA laboratories. It applies to FDA personnel assigned to deliver and discuss \r\nORA laboratory analytical results with the responsible party. The policy does not require the \r\nresponsible party to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the records.3 \r\nFDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should \r\nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are \r\ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. Background \r\nSample collection and analysis (which may include finished product and environmental samples) \r\nare important tools the FDA uses to assess regulatory compliance of FDA-regulated products and \r\nensure public health protection. In general, the FDA does not release the results of any \r\nregulatory testing it conducts until its ORA laboratory analytical results are final and the report is \r\ncompleted, accepted by the responsible FDA official, and any protected information is \r\n                                                 \r\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Strategic Planning and Operational Policy, in the Office of \r\nRegulatory Affairs, in cooperation with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Veterinary \r\nMedicine, the Center for Tobacco Products, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food \r\nand Drug Administration. 2 For purposes of this guidance, the term responsible party may include an owner, operator or agent in charge of the \r\nsite where the regulatory sample is collected, or who may otherwise be responsible for the safety of the product \r\nsampled. In some circumstances, more than one responsible party may need to be contacted. 3 FDA may also share records, including ORA laboratory analytical results, with other entities including state and \r\nlocal governments and other federal agencies in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 20, Subpart E. This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or \r\nAgency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on \r\nFDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the \r\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff \r\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.",

This guidance provides a standardized policy on the release of final ORA laboratory analytical \r\nresults for FDA samples. The FDA will generally release such results when doing so would \r\nadvance public health goals. This guidance clarifies when and how such results could be \r\nreleased. This document also describes the FDA’s policy to orally share, under some \r\ncircumstances, certain preliminary ORA laboratory analytical results (internally referred to as \r\n“Cannot Rule Out” (CRO) results) with the responsible party.7  A CRO result is a preliminary \r\nindication that the sample may yield a final result that could present a public health hazard or \r\nthreat. A CRO result indicates that the laboratory analytical testing is ongoing, and final results \r\nhave not yet been determined. Communicating a CRO result before the FDA confirms the final result is intended to provide the \r\nresponsible party with information to make informed decisions about potential hazards and \r\nproducts on the market, as well as to consider initiating or preparing to initiate appropriate \r\nmitigating strategies to address a potential hazard. III. Policy \r\n \r\nA. Proactive release of CRO ORA laboratory analytical results \r\n \r\n1. In general, FDA should not share CRO results until testing is completed. 2. However, FDA may orally release CRO results to the responsible party after \r\nclearance in accordance with ORA laboratory procedures if the FDA determines that \r\nsuch release is in the interest of public health. FDA’s assessment and consideration \r\nof when to release CRO results should include, but not be limited to: \r\n \r\na. The potential consequences of the injury or illness that could be caused by the \r\nregulated product, if it is ultimately confirmed to contain a poisonous or \r\ndeleterious substance(s) or other hazardous substance, or otherwise deemed to \r\nrepresent a public health threat; \r\nb. Any background information on the danger associated with the poisonous or \r\ndeleterious substance(s) or other hazardous substance/situation related to the \r\nsample under analysis; \r\n                                                 \r\n4 See 21 C.F.R. §§ 20.20(a), 20.105; 21 C.F.R.

Written notification may follow at FDA’s \r\ndiscretion or if required by law. FDA personnel should document the details of the \r\nnotification discussion, as well as the responsible party’s response. 2. In limited cases, FDA may withhold the release of ORA laboratory analytical results, \r\ne.g. if the release is reasonably expected to interfere with an investigation or \r\nenforcement proceeding. 9 See, e.g., section 704(d) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires that, “[w]henever in the \r\ncourse of any such inspection of a factory or other establishment where food is manufactured, processed, or packed, \r\nthe officer or employee making the inspection obtains a sample of any such food, and an analysis is made of such \r\nsample for the purpose of ascertaining whether such food consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or \r\ndecomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food, a copy of the results of such analysis shall be furnished \r\npromptly to the owner, operator, or agent in charge. ” (emphasis added).",

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You \r\ncan use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the \r\ntitle page. I. Introduction: \r\n \r\nThis guidance document is intended to provide guidance and recommendations to FDA-\r\nregulated industry regarding what information firms should give to the Food and Drug \r\nAdministration (FDA) and how they should notify their customers about product recalls. This \r\nguidance is intended to assist those members of industry regulated by the FDA in handling most \r\naspects of a product recall, as well as some removals and corrections which do not meet the \r\ndefinition of a recall under 21 CFR 7.3. The guidance includes a checklist of documentation and \r\ninformation that industry can provide to the FDA that will be used by FDA to evaluate, classify, \r\nmonitor and audit product recalls. Various statutory provisions and regulations, described below, \r\nauthorize the FDA to require recalls of certain products in particular circumstances. Additionally, \r\nsubpart C of part 7 of FDA regulations (21 CFR 7.40-59) provides general guidance for the \r\nvoluntary recall of products, including those recalls initiated by a firm on its own and at the \r\nFDA's request. This guidance provides more specific recommendations and applies to voluntary \r\nand, to the extent that the guidance does not conflict with statute or regulation, mandatory recalls \r\nof all FDA-regulated products (i.e., food, including animal food; drugs, including animal drugs; \r\nmedical and radiological devices and products; cosmetics; tobacco products; and biological \r\nproducts. ) \r\nCertain statutory provisions authorize mandatory recalls of infant formula (FD&C Act § 412(e)-\r\n(g) [21 U.S.C. § 350a(e)-(g)]), medical devices (FD&C Act § 518(e) [21 U.S.C. § 360h(e)]),",

Additionally, FDA regulations set forth specific \r\nrequirements for mandatory infant formula recalls (subpart E of 21 CFR part 107), medical \r\ndevice corrections and removals (21 CFR part 806), mandatory device recalls (21 CFR part 810), \r\nelectronic product notifications and corrections (21 CFR parts 1003 and 1004) and mandatory \r\nrecalls for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (subpart F of 21 CFR part \r\n1271). In addition to the requirements in these statutory provisions and regulations, the \r\nguidance's specific recommendations may also be useful for these types of recalls. In the context \r\nof a mandatory recall, those conditions in the guidance that are set forth in a statute and/or \r\nregulation are requirements, rather than recommendations. The FDA believes that expediting recall activities is vital . Recalling firms are urged to notify the \r\nappropriate FDA Division Recall Coordinator (DRC) or Center contact as soon as a decision is \r\nmade that a recall is appropriate and, if feasible, prior to the issuance of a notice to the public or \r\nwritten communications to customers. To locate your recall coordinator, please check the \r\nfollowing website:  https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/ora-recall-coordinators. After the decision to recall is made, we recommend that you establish communication with a \r\nDRC or Center contact and submit the information outlined in this guidance to your FDA contact \r\nas soon as possible. We also recommend that you  submit information as it becomes available to \r\nyou rather than waiting until all applicable information is ready. This will allow the FDA the \r\nopportunity to review and comment on your recall strategy and to offer guidance and assistance \r\nin your recall process. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be \r\nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA's guidance means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required.",

We recommend you provide the following:  \r\no Indicate the level in the distribution chain to which you are extending the recall. (e.g., wholesale, retail, pharmacy, or consumer/user, such as patient or physician) \r\n If your recall only extends to the wholesale/distributor level, then we \r\nrecommend that you explain your rationale for not recalling to \r\nretail/pharmacy/user level. o Indicate the scope of the recall (i.e., which lots are affected). Indicate your \r\nstrategy for expanding the scope of the recall should additional lots be shown to \r\nbe affected. o Indicate the method of recall communication (e.g., mail, phone, facsimile, e-\r\nmail). We recommend that you include a written communication so customers \r\nwill have a record of the recall and your instructions. o When your customers of the recalled lot(s) can be quickly determined with \r\naccuracy and completeness (e.g., via distribution records), we recommend \r\ndirecting recall communications to only those customers who received the \r\nrecalled lots. Although indiscriminately sending the notification to all customers \r\nmay be simpler, this practice desensitizes customers to recall notices, many of \r\nwhom receive hundreds of inapplicable recall notices per year. If used, indicate \r\nhow written communications will be sent to customers (e.g., e-mail, overnight \r\nmail, first class mail, certified mail, facsimile). o If initial communication is made by phone, provide a copy of the phone script. o If you have a web site, consider posting the recall communication on the web site \r\nas an additional method of customer notification about the recall. (Note: This is \r\nnot recommended as a sole means of customer notification. ) \r\no Provide what you have instructed customers to do with the recalled product. o Identify a recall contact for each customer and address recall communications to \r\nthose recall contacts to reduce the potential for the communication letter to get \r\nmisdirected. 4 Sub-recalls occur when a consignee further distributes a recalled product without changing the product. A sub-\r\nrecall is an action taken by that consignee to notify its own accounts.",

All \r\nreconditioning must be conducted under any applicable current good \r\nmanufacturing practices.  Describe how the recalled (i.e., pre-reconditioned) product will be \r\nsegregated and identified so it is not confused with reconditioned product. Reconditioned product needs to be similarly distinguished from product \r\nsubject to recall that has not been reconditioned. In addition, we recommend that: \r\no You contact your FDA DRC prior to product destruction. The FDA will review \r\nyour proposed method of destruction and may choose to witness the destruction. o You and your customers keep adequate documentation of product destruction \r\n(regardless of whether destruction was witnessed by an FDA investigator). o Field corrections (e.g., product relabeling) be performed by recalling firm \r\nrepresentatives, or under their supervision and control. We do not recommend that \r\na disinterested party such as a wholesaler or retailer be responsible for field \r\ncorrections. For drug recalls: misbranded drugs for re-labeling should be returned \r\nto the recalling firm. o You contact your DRC prior to releasing reconditioned goods.",

For guidance on issuing public warnings, please reference FDA's guidance on Public \r\nWarning and Notification of Recalls Under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C (issued in \r\nFebruary, 2019 \r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/UCM592851.pdf)  \r\n2. GUIDANCE FOR WRITTEN RECALL COMMUNICATIONS TO DIRECT \r\nACCOUNT CONSIGNEES: Recall communications should be flagged in large bold \r\nprint \"URGENT: [insert \"FOOD,\" \"DRUG,\" \"MEDICAL DEVICE,\" etc. ] \r\nRECALL [or CORRECTION]. \" If used, envelopes should be similarly flagged. The \r\nterms \"market withdrawal\" or \"stock recovery\" should not be used because they have \r\nseparate regulatory definitions and do not accurately convey the definition of a recall.5  \r\nThe FDA recommends that you include the following information in a written recall \r\ncommunication to your direct account consignees:  \r\na. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION:  \r\n Include an accurate and complete description of the product and any codes \r\nused to identify the product, e.g., lot/unit numbers, expiration date, serial \r\nnumbers, catalog numbers, model numbers, UDI, and UPC codes.  Consider including a copy of the product label with the recall \r\ncommunication. This could be helpful in identifying and removing the \r\nrecalled product. b. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:  \r\n Identify the reason for the recall and any potential health hazard(s) \r\nassociated with it. Ensure the statement is clear, directly conveys the risk, \r\nand prompts an urgent response by the reader. c. DEPTH OF THE RECALL:  \r\n The recall communication should clearly identify the depth to which the \r\nrecall is to extend (e.g., wholesale, retail, consumer or user level). For \r\nexample, if the recall is to the retail level, a statement should read \"This \r\nrecall should be carried out to the retail level. \" \r\n If the product could have been further distributed by your direct account \r\nconsignees to their customers, then you should include instructions to sub-\r\nrecall. Sub-recall instructions should also include a statement about the \r\ndepth of the recall, e.g., \"If you have further distributed this product, \r\n                                                           \r\n5 See 21 CFR 7.3(g), (h), (j), and (k) for the definitions of “recall,” “correction,” “market withdrawal,” and “stock \r\nrecovery,” respectively.",

This recall should be carried out to the retail level. \" \r\n \r\n If your direct account consignees are instructed to conduct sub-\r\nrecalls, we recommend that you provide them with the date range \r\nthat the recalled product was distributed. Wholesalers/ distributors \r\nmay need this information to identify customers they shipped/sold \r\nrecalled product to.  If applicable, consider providing a sub-recall letter with your \r\ncommunication package for your direct account consignees to \r\nfurther notify their sub accounts. This better ensures that the \r\ninformation provided to sub accounts is accurate and complete. d. INSTRUCTIONS:  \r\n Your recall instructions to your direct account consignees should be clear. For example:  \r\n Remove product from sale \r\n Cease distribution \r\n Sub-recall (if appropriate) \r\n Return or correct product \r\n Include a return response card/form. Your direct account consignees \r\nshould be asked to indicate whether they followed every instruction on the \r\nreturn response card/form. Include a space for the consignee’s signature \r\nand date. We recommend that you provide examples of all recall communications (including letters, \r\nattachments, envelope) to your DRC. 3. IMPORTANT: All customers in the distribution chain should be notified of the recall, \r\npreferably in writing. Here are some examples of why this is important. a. In the case of a human drug recall, the FDA does not believe it is appropriate \r\nfor a sales representative to visit a doctor's office and remove product without \r\nnotifying the physician or responsible staff of the recall. Physicians may be \r\ntreating patients that may suffer or have suffered some adverse effect from the \r\ndrug subject to recall. With knowledge of the recall and the reason for the recall,",

In the case of products sold at retail stores, the FDA does not believe it is \r\nappropriate for a product salesperson or broker representative to remove product \r\nfrom retail shelves without informing store management of the recall. Failure to \r\ninform store management of the recall could result in product that is in storage, in \r\ntransit to the store, or returned by customers, being offered for sale at a later time. The salesperson or broker representative may not have knowledge of or access to \r\nthe recalled products stored in back rooms. Recalled products that are in-transit to \r\nthe store could inadvertently be sold to customers. Recalled products returned by \r\ncustomers could inadvertently be placed back on store shelves. IV. Evaluation of the Recall \r\n \r\n1. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RECALL: \r\nYou should ensure that your recall is effective. Therefore, we recommend that you consider \r\neffectiveness checks for every recall. The purpose of an effectiveness check is to verify your \r\nrecall communication was received by your direct account consignee, and that they understood \r\nand followed the recall instructions. The effectiveness check should also verify your recall \r\nreached the appropriate level in the distribution chain. Your effectiveness check is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of your recall. If your \r\neffectiveness checks indicate that the recall communication was not received and/or its \r\ninstructions were not followed, then you should take steps to make the recall effective. These \r\nsteps may involve using alternative means of contacting your customers or sending out a follow \r\nup communication that better identifies the product, better explains the problem and/or provides \r\nbetter instructions to the consignees. Note: In addition to reviewing the effectiveness checks conducted by a recalling firm, the FDA \r\nmay also contact a percentage of the firm’s customers (a process referred to as audit checks) as a \r\nmeans of assessing whether the recalling firm and its customers are carrying out the recall. If \r\nFDA's audit checks determine the recall to be ineffective, the recalling firm (or sub recalling firm \r\nif such is the case) will then be requested by FDA to take appropriate actions, such as re-issuing \r\nrecall communications. 2.

ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM THAT RESULTED IN THE RECALL: \r\nIt is important to attempt to establish the root cause of a problem that results in a product recall \r\nso that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. We recommend that you provide the root \r\ncause information to your DRC or appropriate Center contact. 4. CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT FUTURE \r\nOCCURRENCES OF THE PROBLEM: \r\nWe recommend that you explain to the FDA the corrective and preventive actions planned or \r\nunderway that will prevent a similar problem from recurring. You should provide this \r\ninformation to your DRC or appropriate Center contact. 5. TERMINATION OF THE RECALL: \r\nWe recommend that you evaluate your recall for termination when all possible customer \r\nresponses have been received and it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the recall \r\nhas been removed and proper disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the \r\ndegree of hazard of the recalled product. A final Recall Status Report and documentation of \r\nrecalled product disposition should be provided to your DRC, after which the FDA will consider \r\nformal termination of the recall action. See 21 CFR 7.55 Termination of a recall. Note: Upon receipt of termination information, the DRC may prepare a recall termination \r\ndocument for center and/or division management concurrence. When concurrence is obtained, \r\nthe FDA division office will notify the recalling firm that the FDA considers the recall \r\nterminated.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not \r\noperate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach \r\nsatisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally \r\nenforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking \r\non a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or \r\nstatutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means \r\nthat something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. APPLICABILITY \r\nThis guidance applies to SGEs and regular Government employees invited to \r\nparticipate in FDA advisory committees subject to FACA. The types of advisory \r\ncommittee meetings within the scope of this guidance are meetings involving particular \r\nmatters as defined in regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). See \r\n5 CFR § 2640.103(a)(1).4   \r\n \r\nIII. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE \r\nAdvisory committees provide independent, expert advice on scientific, technical, \r\nand policy matters related to the development and evaluation of products regulated by \r\nFDA, such as human and animal drugs, biological products, medical devices, foods, \r\ncosmetics, and tobacco products. The advisory committee system enhances FDA’s \r\n                                                                                                                                                                             \r\nhas a potential conflict of interest under 18 U.S.C. 208 and whether, under the statute, a waiver to allow \r\nparticipation in an advisory committee meeting is appropriate. 4  Particular matters involve deliberation, decision, or action that is focused upon the interests of specific \r\npersons or a discrete and identifiable class of persons, and include matters involving specific parties and \r\nmatters of general applicability.

Most FDA advisory committee members are appointed as SGEs.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK \r\nMembers of FDA’s advisory committees are subject to government wide conflict \r\nof interest statutes and standards of ethical conduct regulations. A federal conflict of \r\ninterest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208, prohibits an SGE or regular Government employee with \r\na financial interest that can be affected by the particular matter before the advisory \r\ncommittee from participating in the advisory committee meeting unless a waiver is \r\ngranted or the financial interest is covered by one of the regulatory exemptions found at 5 \r\nCFR Part 2640. The statute is applicable government-wide, and specifies the \r\ncircumstances under which FDA may grant waivers to permit participation in specific \r\nmeetings. An additional statutory requirement applies to FDA advisory committees. FDA is directed to disclose on its website the type, nature, and magnitude of the financial \r\ninterests of each advisory committee member who has received a waiver under 18 U.S.C. § 208 and the reasons for granting each waiver prior to the advisory committee meeting, \r\nincluding, as appropriate, the public health interest in having the expertise of the member \r\nwith respect to the particular matter.9  A waiver for an SGE must be based on a \r\ndetermination that the need for the SGE’s service outweighs the potential for a conflict of \r\n                                                           \r\n9 This statutory disclosure requirement has changed over time. For example, under § 505(n)(4) of the \r\nFD&C Act, enacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of \r\n1997, advisory committee members serving on panels related to new drugs could only receive a waiver of a \r\nconflict of interest requirement “upon public disclosure of such conflict of interest if such waiver is \r\nnecessary to afford the panel essential expertise. ”  The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of \r\n2007 repealed § 505(n)(4) and enacted § 712. As enacted at that time, § 712 also contained provisions \r\nregarding waivers of conflicts of interests and public disclosures of such waivers. It had several differences \r\nfrom § 505(n)(4), including that it extended its conflict of interest rules to all FDA advisory committee \r\nmembers. In 2012, Congress enacted FDASIA, which amended § 712, including by removing the \r\n“essential expertise” agency-specific waiver standard. The requirement to make disclosures of waivers is \r\nnow in § 712(c).",

A template that FDA intends to use \r\nwhen preparing this document, based on information already submitted by the \r\nindividual,10 is found in Appendix 1. Using the template format, FDA will list personal \r\nand immediate family interests separately from other imputed interests. Other imputed \r\nfinancial interests are those that are attributed to the individual through his employer (i.e., \r\nthe employer has a relevant financial interest) or through his position as an officer, \r\ndirector, trustee, or general partner. Even though the individual may have no personal \r\ninvolvement in these interests, imputed financial interests that can be affected by the \r\nparticular matter before the advisory committee are considered conflicts of interest under \r\nthe applicable law. First, FDA will identify the type of interest. The template provides several \r\nexamples, such as stocks/investments and employment. Second, FDA will identify the \r\nnature of the interest. The template instructs that the name of the company or institution \r\nbe identified, along with indicating whether the firm is the sponsor, a competing firm, or \r\nother affected entity. Third, FDA will indicate the magnitude of an interest by a dollar \r\nrange, such as $0 to 5000. The agency will request that the individual in need of a waiver \r\nreview the document and acknowledge his/her understanding that FDA will publicly \r\ndisclose the information. FDA does not intend to publicly disclose financial interest information if the \r\ninformation is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or \r\n                                                           \r\n10 See section III above.",

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind \r\nFDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements \r\nof the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact \r\nthe FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate \r\nFDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance. I. INTRODUCTION \r\n \r\nThis document provides guidance to industry sponsors, applicants, and petitioners \r\n(referred to collectively as sponsors) who develop, prepare, or submit briefing materials \r\nthat will be given to advisory committee members as background information before an \r\nopen FDA advisory committee meeting.2  This guidance will help sponsors develop, \r\norganize, and submit advisory committee briefing materials for public release and should \r\nhelp minimize the time and resources spent in preparing these materials for public \r\navailability. The guidance also describes the process FDA intends to follow when we \r\nmake briefing materials available to the public. In addition, the Appendices provide \r\nrecommended timelines for preparing and submitting briefing materials to us.3     \r\n \r\nAn important goal of this guidance is to help ensure that briefing materials are made \r\navailable to the public as provided under section 10(b) of the Federal Advisory \r\nCommittee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2). The guidance includes recommendations on \r\n                                                 \r\n1 This guidance has been prepared by a working group with members from across FDA. 2 Most FDA advisory committee meetings are open to the public. However, sometimes a portion of a \r\nmeeting will be closed to the public under 21 C.F.R. § 14.27. This guidance only applies to briefing \r\nmaterials prepared for open advisory committee meetings or for the open portions of such meetings. 3 This guidance, which applies to all FDA open advisory committee meetings or open portions of such \r\nmeetings, replaces three previously issued draft guidances: 1) \"Guidance for Industry: Disclosing \r\nInformation Provided to Advisory Committees in Connection with Open Advisory Committee Meetings \r\nRelated to the Testing or Approval of New Drugs and Convened by the Center for Drug Evaluation and \r\nResearch, Beginning on January 1, 2000\" (dated December 1999); 2) \"Guidance for Industry: Disclosing \r\nInformation Provided to Advisory Committees in Connection with Open Advisory Committee Meetings \r\nRelated to the Testing or Approval of Biologic Products and Convened by the Center for Biologics \r\nEvaluation and Research\" (dated February 2001); and 3) \"Availability of Information Given to Advisory \r\nCommittee Members in Connection with CDRH Open Public Panel Meetings; Draft Guidance for Industry \r\nand FDA Staff\" (dated July 18,  2001). 4",

Our guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, \r\nguidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as \r\nrecommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use \r\nof the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, \r\nbut not required. II. BACKGROUND  \r\n \r\nA. Relevant Statutes and Regulations \r\n \r\nAs stated earlier, under section 10(b) of FACA, any materials made available to an \r\nadvisory committee also must be made available to the public. The public availability of \r\nthese materials, however, is subject to FOIA, and FOIA exempts certain types of \r\ninformation from public disclosure. We interpret FACA to require that, with respect to \r\nany open advisory committee meeting convened pursuant to FACA, whenever \r\npracticable and subject to any applicable FOIA exemptions, those materials that we \r\nprovide to advisory committee members in connection with that meeting must be made \r\navailable for public inspection and copying before or at the time of the advisory \r\ncommittee meeting. Several FDA regulations (e.g., 21 CFR §§ 20.61, 20.63, 171.1, 314.430, 514.12, 601.51, \r\nand 860.5) protect information that is exempt from public disclosure under FOIA. We \r\ninterpret our regulations to be consistent with FACA and intend to exercise our discretion \r\nunder our regulations in a manner consistent with FACA and FOIA. This guidance \r\nshould help ensure that information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA will not \r\nbe made publicly available. B. Advisory Committee Meetings – General Information \r\nIII. We convene advisory committee meetings for a variety of different purposes. Some \r\nmeetings discuss particular matters such as the approval or testing of products. Topics \r\ncommonly discussed at this type of advisory committee meeting often involve marketing \r\napplications/submissions such as:  \r\n  \r\n• New drug applications and application supplements; \r\n• New animal drug applications and application supplements; \r\n• Biologics license applications and application supplements; \r\n• Premarket approval applications for medical devices and their supplements; \r\n• Premarket notifications for medical devices; and \r\n• Medical device classifications and reclassifications. 5",

III. MAKING BRIEFING MATERIALS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC  \r\n \r\nA. Scope of Briefing Materials Subject to this Guidance \r\n \r\nThis guidance uses the term “briefing materials” to describe the package of information \r\nthat we provide to advisory committee members before a meeting. The briefing materials \r\nusually contain information prepared by us and/or the sponsor (if the meeting involves an \r\napplication or a particular product). Although interested persons (i.e., individuals or \r\norganizations who are not sponsors) may submit information to an advisory committee \r\npursuant to 21 C.F.R. §§ 14.29 or 14.35(d), this guidance does not consider those \r\nsubmissions to be “briefing materials.”4  \r\n \r\nB. Timelines for Submitting and Making Briefing Materials Publicly \r\nAvailable \r\n \r\nFor an open advisory committee meeting for which the briefing materials may contain \r\ninformation that, under certain circumstances, could be considered to be exempt from \r\npublic disclosure under FOIA, we intend (as set forth in the Appendices) to post a \r\npublicly available version of the briefing materials on our Web site no later than two full \r\nbusiness days5 before the day the advisory committee meeting (or the part of the meeting \r\nto which the materials pertain) is scheduled to occur. With respect to meetings for which the briefing materials do not contain information that, \r\nunder certain circumstances, could be considered exempt from public disclosure under \r\nFOIA, we will try to make the briefing materials available on our Web site more than two \r\nfull business days before the day the advisory committee meeting (or the part of the \r\nmeeting to which the materials pertain) is scheduled to occur. We anticipate that \r\nmeetings subject to this timeline will normally address general matters such as guidance \r\ndocuments and policy issues related to FDA-regulated products. Even when a sponsor states that its briefing materials are fully releasable (as described in \r\nsection IV.D.), we intend to post the briefing materials in accordance with the timelines \r\nin the Appendices if the briefing materials contain the type of information that, under \r\ncertain circumstances, could be considered to be exempt from public disclosure under \r\nFOIA. Please note that, as described in the Appendices, we intend to post both sponsor-\r\n                                                 \r\n4 Information submitted by interested persons is considered to be publicly disclosable and must conform to \r\nthe requirements of 21 CFR § 10.20. Failure to comply with the requirements will result in rejection of the \r\nsubmission for filing or, if it is filed, in exclusion from consideration of any portion that fails to comply (21 \r\nCFR § 10.20(c)(6)). 5 In this guidance, a “business day” is a day that we are officially open for business. 6",

If an advisory committee meeting is scheduled to address more than one topic, separate \r\nbriefing materials may be prepared for the different topics on the meeting agenda. For \r\nmeetings that last more than one day, we intend to post the publicly available version of \r\nthe briefing materials on our Web site no later than two full business days before the \r\ntopic to which the materials pertain will be discussed. For example, assume that two \r\ndrugs, A and B, will be discussed on days 1 and 2 respectively. We would make the \r\nbriefing materials on drug A available no later than two full business days before the \r\nscheduled day 1 of the advisory committee meeting and the briefing materials on drug B \r\navailable no later than two full business days before the scheduled day 2 of the advisory \r\ncommittee meeting. Please note that the timelines for sponsors to submit materials to us \r\nare linked to the first day of the meeting and not to the specific day on which a particular \r\ntopic will be discussed. Thus, in our example, the sponsor for drug B would have the \r\nsame deadline for submitting materials to us as the sponsor for drug A, even though the \r\ndiscussions for their drugs (and the posting of their briefing materials) would occur on \r\ndifferent days. The Appendices to this guidance provide timelines for preparing and submitting briefing \r\nmaterials to us. Appendix A provides timelines for FDA-prepared briefing materials and \r\nsponsor-prepared briefing materials in those instances where the sponsor states that its \r\nmaterials are fully releasable to the public. Appendix B provides timelines for briefing \r\nmaterials in instances where the sponsor asserts that its materials are not fully releasable. Please note that the timelines in the Appendices do not provide for formal predisclosure \r\nnotification to sponsors pursuant to 21 CFR § 20.61(e) and (f). The predisclosure \r\nnotification requirements in that regulation apply only where the disclosure is to be made \r\nin response to a specific request for our records. The disclosures contemplated here are \r\nnot made in response to a request for our records, but to comply with FACA. Nevertheless, the timelines in the Appendices are at least as generous as the timeframes \r\nfor notification under 21 CFR § 20.61. This guidance does, however, constitute public notice under 21 CFR §14.35(d)(2) that a \r\nsponsor should submit information to us within the timelines listed in the Appendices if \r\nthe sponsor wants the advisory committee to consider that information before the \r\nmeeting. If we do not receive a sponsor’s briefing materials within the applicable \r\ntimeline in the Appendices, we do not intend to provide the sponsor’s briefing materials \r\nto the members of the committee, and the committee will not consider the sponsor’s \r\nmaterials before the meeting. C. Postponing the Public Release of Briefing Materials \r\n \r\nOn occasion, the issue of whether certain information in the briefing materials should be \r\nmade available to the public may need to be decided in court. If a federal court directs us \r\nto not release information in briefing materials, we will not release that information and \r\n \r\n7",

The more time we need to \r\ncomplete this process, the earlier the sponsors may need to submit materials for an \r\nadvisory committee meeting. If the preparation of the materials occurs too far in advance \r\nof a meeting, the materials may not adequately address the issues that will be the subject \r\nof the meeting because those issues will not yet have been fully identified. A. General Recommendations on Preparing Briefing Materials \r\n \r\nFor open advisory committee meetings that involve sponsor-prepared briefing materials,   \r\napproximately 55 business days before the meeting is scheduled to occur, FDA intends to \r\nnotify a sponsor that an advisory committee will consider an issue that is directly relevant \r\nto the sponsor. We will explain the meeting’s focus to the sponsor and also may advise \r\nthe sponsor about the information it may wish to include in its briefing materials. To \r\nfacilitate the review and eventual posting of sponsor-prepared briefing materials, we \r\nstrongly recommend that sponsors submit both paper and electronic versions of their \r\nmaterials. Sponsors should consult the appropriate FDA component about compatible \r\nelectronic formats and consult the Designated Federal Official6 for a given meeting to \r\ndetermine the appropriate number of paper copies.7    \r\n \r\nWe emphasize that a sponsor’s submissions should include only information related to \r\nthe issue being discussed by the committee. Statements or suggestions that could be \r\nviewed as misleading or promotional (e.g., statements that go beyond study conclusions \r\nor speculate about clinical or commercial implications not supported by the data) are \r\ninappropriate for inclusion in the briefing materials. In addition, statements or language \r\nthat are defamatory, irrelevant, or intemperate are inappropriate for inclusion in briefing \r\nmaterials and should be avoided. 6 The Designated Federal Official is a federal employee who is responsible for the overall administrative \r\nmanagement of an advisory committee. 7 If an advisory committee meeting involves advisory committees from different agency components (e.g., \r\na joint meeting of a Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory committee and a Center for \r\nDrug Evaluation and Research advisory committee), sponsors should consult the relevant Designated \r\nFederal Officials of the two committees as to the Designated Federal Official coordinating the briefing \r\nmaterial process. 8",

D. Fully Releasable Sponsor Briefing Materials \r\n \r\nTo shorten the process for complying with FACA's disclosure requirements, we strongly \r\nencourage sponsors to submit briefing materials that may be released to the public, in \r\naccordance with the timelines in Appendix A, in their entirety without redaction (i.e., that \r\ndo not contain any information that the sponsor asserts is exempt from disclosure under \r\nFOIA). Sponsors also benefit from preparing fully releasable briefing materials because \r\nsuch briefing materials eliminate the need for us to redact trade secret and/or confidential \r\ncommercial information and, as a result, can be submitted to us closer in time to the \r\nadvisory committee meeting than briefing materials containing information that the \r\nsponsor asserts is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. As a result, sponsors may be able \r\nto devote more time to preparing their submissions before the advisory committee \r\nmeeting occurs (see timelines in the Appendices). If a sponsor chooses to submit fully releasable briefing materials that it agrees can be \r\nposted in accordance with the timeline in Appendix A, it should mark the materials as:  \r\n“Advisory Committee Briefing Materials: Available for Public Release. ” \r\n \r\nWhen we receive briefing materials marked as fully releasable, we will review the \r\nmaterials for completeness. We will assume that sponsors who mark their materials \r\n“Available for Public Release” have carefully reviewed the included materials to make \r\nsure that they all may be made available to the public without redaction. Sponsors should \r\nnot expect us to identify trade secret or confidential commercial information in briefing \r\nmaterials marked as “Available for Public Release. ”  We will, however, review sponsor \r\nbriefing materials for information that, if publicly released, would constitute a clearly \r\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and we will redact such information. This \r\nreview time is reflected in the timeline in Appendix A. Additionally, as stated in section \r\nIII.B., and as set forth in Appendix A, FDA intends to post both the sponsor-prepared \r\nbriefing materials and the agency-prepared briefing materials at the same time. As \r\ndiscussed in section IV.F., and as set forth in Appendix A, the various activities relating \r\nto our briefing materials will not have been completed at the time the sponsor submits \r\nbriefing materials that it indicates are fully releasable. E. Sponsor Briefing Materials that Contain Information Claimed to be \r\nExempt from Disclosure \r\n \r\nA sponsor may elect to prepare advisory committee briefing materials that contain \r\ninformation that it believes is exempt from disclosure under FOIA (see section IV.C. for \r\na discussion of what types of information we generally will consider to be exempt from \r\ndisclosure).

The complete version of the briefing materials (that is, the one that would not be \r\navailable for public release because it includes the information the sponsor believes is \r\nexempt from disclosure under FOIA) should be clearly marked as:  “Draft: Advisory \r\nCommittee Briefing Materials: Not for Public Release: Contains Trade Secret and/or \r\nConfidential Commercial Information. ”  \r\n \r\nFor the version of the briefing materials that would be publicly releasable, the sponsor \r\nshould prepare and submit a copy of the same materials as are included in the version that \r\nis not for public release, but this version should indicate what information the sponsor \r\nbelieves is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Sponsors should indicate the \r\ninformation they believe is exempt by providing a redacted copy. We suggest that, when \r\nredacting information, sponsors should identify any proposed deletions and indicate \r\nexactly how much material should be redacted.

For example, a sponsor could \r\ninclude a statement such as “two paragraphs have been deleted,” or “five pages have been \r\nremoved. ”  For each document or portion of a document that the sponsor believes is \r\nexempt from disclosure under FOIA, the sponsor should explain, in detail, why it \r\nbelieves that the information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. We caution that, to \r\nthe extent that the sponsor intends to discuss specific information during the open portion \r\nof the meeting, it will be difficult for the sponsor to claim that the information is exempt \r\nfrom disclosure under FOIA.

When the discussions are concluded, we will \r\nnotify the sponsor of our final decision.

If we determine that our briefing materials contain information that, under certain \r\ncircumstances, could be considered to be confidential commercial or trade secret \r\ninformation belonging to a sponsor, the portions of timelines in the Appendices \r\npertaining to sharing our briefing materials with sponsors will apply, and we will send \r\nour briefing materials to the sponsor as described in the timelines. If the briefing \r\nmaterials include information pertaining to more than one sponsor, we will send only the \r\nrelevant portion to each sponsor. We will discuss with each sponsor any disagreements it \r\nmay have about the disclosability of information in the materials. We note that, in \r\ncircumstances where the sponsor has submitted briefing materials that it has asserted are \r\nnot fully releasable, we may already have had discussions with the sponsor regarding the \r\nreleasability of certain information in the sponsor's briefing materials and have informed \r\nthe sponsor of our final decision regarding the redaction of information from its briefing \r\nmaterials. Thus, our discussion with the sponsor regarding our briefing materials should \r\nfocus on new issues and information, and not on issues or information that were \r\npreviously discussed with the sponsor in the context of the sponsor's briefing materials. When the discussions of our briefing materials are concluded, we will notify each \r\nsponsor of our final decision regarding the public availability of the information in our \r\nbriefing materials. If the sponsor disagrees with our determination regarding the \r\nreleasability of information in our briefing materials, the sponsor may seek judicial \r\nreview in federal court to prevent us from releasing the information. If the sponsor \r\nchooses this option, we will not release the information that is in dispute and may \r\npostpone the advisory committee meeting where the information would be discussed until \r\nthe matter is resolved. G. Posting Briefing Materials on FDA’s Web Site \r\n \r\nWe will post the briefing materials for an open advisory committee meeting subject to \r\nthis guidance on our Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/acwhatsnew.htm. The materials also will be available in hard copy at our Division of Dockets \r\nManagement’s Public Reading Room.10  We will post only the publicly available \r\nsponsor-prepared briefing materials and the publicly available FDA-prepared briefing \r\nmaterials on our Web site. To avoid any misunderstanding that we have endorsed the contents of a sponsor’s \r\nbriefing materials by posting them on our Web site, we will display the following \r\nstatement with the sponsor’s briefing materials placed on our Web site:  \r\n \r\n                                                 \r\n10 The Public Reading Room is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The Public Reading \r\nRoom is located at 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, Maryland 20857. 14",

It does not establish any rights for any person and is \r\nnot binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the \r\nrequirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, \r\ncontact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. Introduction \r\n \r\nThis guidance provides a recommended maximum level of 10 parts per million (ppm) for lead as \r\nan impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics that are marketed in the \r\nUnited States. FDA (or “we”) has concluded that a recommended maximum level of 10 ppm for \r\nlead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics would not pose a \r\nhealth risk. We consider the recommended maximum lead level to be achievable with the use of \r\ngood manufacturing practices and to be consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for \r\nsimilar products recommended by other countries. For additional discussion of the scientific and \r\nlegal background and rationale underlying this recommended level, see “Supporting Document \r\nfor Recommended Maximum Lead Level in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied \r\nCosmetics” (http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocuments/ucm517327.htm). The issuance of this guidance supports our effort to limit human exposure to lead in finished \r\nFDA-regulated cosmetic products by educating new manufacturers who wish to enter the market \r\nand encouraging current manufacturers to continue to follow or improve on voluntary good \r\nmanufacturing practices that limit trace amounts of lead as an impurity. This guidance applies to \r\ncosmetic lip products (such as lipsticks, lip glosses, and lip liners) and externally applied \r\ncosmetics (such as eye shadows, blushes, shampoos, and body lotions) marketed in the United \r\nStates.2  This guidance does not apply to topically applied products that are classified as drugs or \r\nto hair dyes that contain lead acetate as an ingredient. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors in the Center for Food Safety and Applied \r\nNutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 2 Cosmetic lip products are applied to the mucous membrane and therefore are not considered externally applied \r\ncosmetics (See 21 CFR 70.3(v)).",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft-Not for Implementation \r\n 4 \r\nFDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \r\nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. Background \r\n \r\nWe regulate cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and Fair \r\nPackaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). These laws require that cosmetics marketed in the United \r\nStates be safe under their intended and customary conditions of use, and be properly labeled. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by FDA. However, pre-market approval is \r\nrequired for the color additives used as ingredients in cosmetics. Although we have not set limits for lead as an impurity in cosmetics, most listed color additives \r\nhave specifications for lead as an impurity as part of our requirements for their safe use. This \r\nguidance supports our effort to limit human exposure to lead in finished products by \r\nrecommending a maximum level of 10 ppm lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and \r\nexternally applied cosmetics. The International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation and regions such as Canada and the \r\nEuropean Union have set a limit of 10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetics based on \r\nconsiderations of a reasonably achievable level, scientific risk assessment, good manufacturing \r\npractices, technical feasibility, and appropriate analytical methods (Refs. 1, 2). This guidance is \r\nconsistent with those efforts. III. Discussion \r\n \r\nA. Recommended Maximum Lead Level in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied \r\nCosmetics \r\n \r\nBetween 2007 and 2009, FDA scientists developed and validated a total dissolution method for \r\nanalyzing lead in lipstick and used this method to determine the lead content in a selection of 20 \r\ncommercially available lipsticks on the U.S. market (Ref. 3). In 2010, using the same analytical \r\nmethod, we obtained results for lead content in 400 lipsticks and other cosmetic lip products \r\navailable in the U.S., and in 2012, obtained similar results for an additional 30 cosmetic lip \r\nproducts (Refs. 4, 5, 6, 7). Finally, between 2012 and 2013, we used a more common extraction \r\nmethod for determining lead in an additional 29 cosmetic lip products (Ref. 7). The lead levels \r\nfound in our surveys ranged from 0.026 ppm (the detection limit of the total dissolution method \r\nfor the studies) to a maximum of 7.19 ppm in one lipstick. The average lead concentration was \r\n1.09 ppm. Between 2011 and 2012, we used a total dissolution method to obtain results for lead content in \r\n120 externally applied cosmetic products available on the U.S. market, which included eye \r\nshadows, blushes, body lotions, mascaras, foundations, body powders, compact powders,",

Between 2012 and 2013, we used the extraction \r\nmethod for determining lead in an additional 86 externally applied cosmetics (Ref. 7). The lead \r\nlevels found in our surveys ranged from 0.0084 ppm (the detection limit of the total dissolution \r\nmethod for these studies) to a maximum of 14 ppm in one eye shadow and one blush. The \r\naverage lead concentration ranged from below the detection limit in shaving creams to 4.6 ppm \r\nin compact powders. These surveys indicate that levels of lead in the cosmetic lip products and externally applied \r\ncosmetics we have sampled are for the most part well below 10 ppm, leading us to expect that \r\nthis recommended maximum level is achievable by all manufacturers of these products. However, in our surveys, which do not necessarily reflect the full range of products that are \r\ncurrently on the market, a small number of samples had lead levels that exceed the maximum \r\nlevel we are recommending. Our goal is to ensure that cosmetic lip products and externally \r\napplied cosmetics do not contain lead as an impurity at levels that would pose a health risk. We \r\nhave determined that a maximum level of 10 ppm in cosmetic lip products and externally applied \r\ncosmetics would not pose a health risk, but we encourage manufacturers of these products to \r\nfollow or continue to follow manufacturing practices that allow them to achieve levels of lead \r\nlower than 10 ppm whenever feasible. We have concluded that a maximum level of 10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip \r\nproducts and externally applied cosmetics should be readily achievable by manufacturers that \r\nsource their ingredients appropriately and use good manufacturing practices. Modern analytical \r\ncapability permits determination of lead at ppm levels, thus enabling manufacturers to avoid the \r\npurchase of ingredients with unacceptably high levels of lead and to determine whether lead is \r\nintroduced into their products during the manufacturing process. B. Exposure Assessment and Public Health Impact of Recommended Maximum Lead Level \r\nin Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied Cosmetics \r\n \r\nAs explained in more detail in our supporting document, the routes of exposure to lead from \r\ncosmetic lip products are incidental ingestion and dermal absorption and the route of exposure to \r\nlead from externally applied cosmetics is dermal absorption. To assess the exposure to lead from \r\ncosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetic products, we assumed these products \r\ncontain 10 ppm lead because, as noted above, that impurity level should be readily achievable by \r\nmanufacturers. Additionally, 10 ppm lead is consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for \r\nsimilar products recommended by the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation and \r\nregions such as Canada and the European Union. 1. Exposure to Lead from Cosmetic Lip Products \r\n \r\nThe composition of cosmetic lip products limits the ability for lead present as an impurity to \r\ndiffuse from a product and be absorbed by the skin. Therefore, dermal absorption of lead from \r\ncosmetic lip products is negligible, and we have concluded that systemic exposure to lead from \r\nthese products is primarily by incidental ingestion.",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft-Not for Implementation \r\n 6 \r\nWe used an approach previously employed by FDA for estimating exposure to lead from food to \r\nestimate exposure to lead from cosmetic lip products (Ref. 8). We estimated that maximum \r\nexposure to 10 ppm lead from a cosmetic lip product is 0.24 μg/day for adults and adolescents \r\nage 13 years or older and 0.024 μg/day for children age 12 years or younger (assuming that \r\nchildren age 12 years or younger use 10% as much of these products as adults) (Ref. 9). We \r\ndetermined that the potential elevation of blood lead levels from 10 ppm lead in these products is \r\ntoo small to be measured in routine blood analysis and requires state of the art analytical \r\ntechnology (Ref. 10). 2. Exposure to Lead from Externally Applied Cosmetics \r\n \r\nDermal absorption of lead from externally applied cosmetics is very small. Results for lead \r\nuptake by the skin were reported for four lead compounds that resemble cosmetic ingredients \r\n(Ref. 11). Based on those data, we estimated that only a very small amount (0.41%) of the lead \r\npresent as an impurity in an externally applied cosmetic is absorbed by the skin. The amount of exposure to lead as an impurity in externally applied cosmetics depends on \r\nwhether the product is a “leave-on” product (such as eye shadow or body lotion) or a “rinse-off” \r\nproduct (such as shampoo or shaving cream). The amount of exposure also depends on how \r\nmuch product is applied to the skin. For example, eye shadows are applied in very small \r\namounts (40 mg/day) and only around the eyes (Ref. 12). Because dermal absorption of lead is \r\nso small, we estimated that exposure to 10 ppm lead from an eye shadow is only 1.64 × 10-3 \r\nμg/day for adults and adolescents age 13 years or older and 1.64 × 10-4 μg/day for children age \r\n12 years or younger (assuming that children age 12 years or younger use 10% as much eye \r\nshadow as adults). This means that exposure to lead from an eye shadow is approximately 150 \r\ntimes lower than exposure to lead from a cosmetic lip product. The amount of exposure to lead as an impurity in a product such as body lotion is higher because \r\naverage applications are higher (8.7 g/day) (Ref. 9). Based on body surface area calculations \r\nfrom reported height and weight data, we estimated that children age 6-18 use 65% as much \r\nbody lotion as adults age ≥19 and children age 1-5 use 34% as much body lotion as adults age \r\n≥19 (Refs. 10, 13). We then estimated that exposure to 10 ppm lead from a body lotion is 0.36 \r\nμg/day for adults age ≥19, 0.23 μg/day for children age 6-18, and 0.12 μg/day for children age 1-\r\n5. In addition, our surveys found that body lotions actually contain very little lead (0.04 to 0.10 \r\nμg/g) (Refs. 6, 7). Therefore, we estimated that exposure to lead from a body lotion containing \r\n0.10 μg/g (0.10 ppm) lead is 0.0036 μg/day for adults age ≥19, 0.0023 μg/day for children age 6-\r\n18, and 0.0012 μg/day for children age 1-5, or 67 times lower for adults and up to 20 times lower \r\nfor children than exposure to lead from a cosmetic lip product. Exposure to lead from externally applied cosmetics is up to 150 times lower than exposure to \r\nlead from cosmetic lip products. Therefore, the potential elevation of blood lead levels from 10 \r\nppm lead in these products is too small to be measured in routine blood analysis and requires \r\nstate of the art analytical technology (Ref. 10). 3.

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft-Not for Implementation \r\n7 \r\nBased on our exposure assessment, we have concluded that a recommended maximum level of \r\n10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics would \r\nnot pose a health risk. The issuance of this guidance supports our effort to limit human exposure \r\nto lead in finished FDA-regulated cosmetic products by educating new manufacturers who wish \r\nto enter the market and encouraging current manufacturers to continue to follow or improve on \r\nvoluntary good manufacturing practices that limit trace amounts of lead as an impurity. We \r\nconsider the recommended maximum lead level to be achievable with the use of good \r\nmanufacturing practices and to be consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for similar \r\nproducts recommended by other countries. Lead is a chemical element for which toxicity in humans has been well documented (Ref. 14). It \r\nmay occur as an impurity in any of the ingredients used in cosmetic lip products and externally \r\napplied cosmetics due to its background presence in the environment. Cosmetics manufacturers \r\nare responsible for avoiding potentially harmful levels of lead in their finished products. Our \r\ndata show that over 99% of the cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics on the \r\nU.S. market contain lead at levels below our recommended maximum level. Therefore, we \r\nencourage firms to continue the manufacturing practices that achieve these lower levels of lead \r\nin their finished products. C. Enforcement Policy for Lead in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied \r\nCosmetics \r\nFDA is prepared to take enforcement action against any cosmetic lip product or externally \r\napplied cosmetic containing lead at levels that may harm consumers. FDA intends to consider \r\nseveral factors in bringing enforcement actions regarding lead in cosmetic lip products and \r\nexternally applied cosmetics, including the level of lead present, the particular product, and the \r\nconditions of use for the product.

We anticipate initiating rulemaking to change part 11 as a result of that re-35 \r\nexamination. This guidance explains that we will narrowly interpret the scope of part 11. While 36 \r\nthe re-examination of part 11 is under way, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with 37 \r\nrespect to certain part 11 requirements. That is, we do not intend to take enforcement action to 38 \r\nenforce compliance with the validation, audit trail, record retention, and record copying 39 \r\nrequirements of part 11 as explained in this guidance. However, records must still be maintained 40 \r\nor submitted in accordance with the underlying predicate rules, and the Agency can take 41 \r\nregulatory action for noncompliance with such predicate rules. 42 \r\n 43 \r\nIn addition, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion and do not intend to take (or 44 \r\nrecommend) action to enforce any part 11 requirements with regard to systems that were 45 \r\noperational before August 20, 1997, the effective date of part 11 (commonly known as legacy 46 \r\nsystems) under the circumstances described in section III.C.3 of this guidance. 47 \r\n 48 \r\nNote that part 11 remains in effect and that this exercise of enforcement discretion applies only 49 \r\nas identified in this guidance. 50 \r\n 51 \r\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 52 \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should 53 \r\nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are 54 \r\ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 55 \r\nrecommended, but not required. 56 \r\n 57 \r\n 58 \r\nII. BACKGROUND 59 \r\n 60 \r\nIn March of 1997, FDA issued final part 11 regulations that provide criteria for acceptance by 61 \r\nFDA, under certain circumstances, of electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten 62 \r\nsignatures executed to electronic records as equivalent to paper records and handwritten 63 \r\nsignatures executed on paper. These regulations, which apply to all FDA program areas, were 64 \r\nintended to permit the widest possible use of electronic technology, compatible with FDA's 65 \r\nresponsibility to protect the public health. 66 \r\n 67 \r\nAfter part 11 became effective in August 1997, significant discussions ensued among industry, 68 \r\ncontractors, and the Agency concerning the interpretation and implementation of the regulations. 69 \r\nFDA has (1) spoken about part 11 at many conferences and met numerous times with an industry 70 \r\ncoalition and other interested parties in an effort to hear more about potential part 11 issues; (2) 71 \r\npublished a compliance policy guide, CPG 7153.17: Enforcement Policy: 21 CFR Part 11; 72 \r\nElectronic Records; Electronic Signatures; and (3) published numerous draft guidance 73 \r\ndocuments including the following:  74 \r\n                                                 \r\n4 See Pharmaceutical CGMPs for the 21st Century:  A Risk-Based Approach; A Science and Risk-Based Approach \r\nto Product Quality Regulation Incorporating an Integrated Quality Systems Approach at \r\nwww.fda.gov/oc/guidance/gmp.html.",

These concerns have been raised particularly in the areas of part 11 requirements 89 \r\nfor validation, audit trails, record retention, record copying, and legacy systems. 90 \r\n 91 \r\nAs a result of these concerns, we decided to review the part 11 documents and related issues, 92 \r\nparticularly in light of the Agency's CGMP initiative. In the Federal Register of February 4, 93 \r\n2003 (68 FR 5645), we announced the withdrawal of the draft guidance for industry, 21 CFR 94 \r\nPart 11; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, Electronic Copies of Electronic Records. 95 \r\nWe had decided we wanted to minimize industry time spent reviewing and commenting on the 96 \r\ndraft guidance when that draft guidance may no longer represent our approach under the CGMP 97 \r\ninitiative. Then, in the Federal Register of February 25, 2003 (68 FR 8775), we announced the 98 \r\nwithdrawal of the part 11 draft guidance documents on validation, glossary of terms, time 99 \r\nstamps,5 maintenance of electronic records, and CPG 7153.17. We received valuable public 100 \r\ncomments on these draft guidances, and we plan to use that information to help with future 101 \r\ndecision-making with respect to part 11. We do not intend to re-issue these draft guidance 102 \r\ndocuments or the CPG. 103 \r\n 104 \r\nWe are now re-examining part 11, and we anticipate initiating rulemaking to revise provisions of 105 \r\nthat regulation. To avoid unnecessary resource expenditures to comply with part 11 106 \r\nrequirements, we are issuing this guidance to describe how we intend to exercise enforcement 107 \r\ndiscretion with regard to certain part 11 requirements during the re-examination of part 11.

We 130 \r\nintend to enforce all other provisions of part 11 including, but not limited to, certain controls for 131 \r\nclosed systems in § 11.10. For example, we intend to enforce provisions related to the following 132 \r\ncontrols and requirements: 133 \r\n 134 \r\n• limiting system access to authorized individuals 135 \r\n• use of operational system checks 136 \r\n• use of authority checks 137 \r\n• use of device checks 138 \r\n• determination that persons who develop, maintain, or use electronic systems have the 139 \r\neducation, training, and experience to perform their assigned tasks 140 \r\n• establishment of and adherence to written policies that hold individuals accountable for 141 \r\nactions initiated under their electronic signatures 142 \r\n• appropriate controls over systems documentation 143 \r\n• controls for open systems corresponding to controls for closed systems bulleted above (§ 144 \r\n11.30) 145 \r\n• requirements related to electronic signatures (e.g., §§ 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200, and 146 \r\n11.300) 147 \r\n 148 \r\nWe expect continued compliance with these provisions, and we will continue to enforce them. 149 \r\nFurthermore, persons must comply with applicable predicate rules, and records that are required 150 \r\nto be maintained or submitted must remain secure and reliable in accordance with the predicate 151 \r\nrules. 152 \r\n 153 \r\nB. Details of Approach – Scope of Part 11 154 \r\n 155 \r\n1. Narrow Interpretation of Scope  156 \r\n 157 \r\nWe understand that there is some confusion about the scope of part 11.

As a result, we want to clarify 161 \r\nthat the Agency intends to interpret the scope of part 11 narrowly. 162 \r\n 163 \r\nUnder the narrow interpretation of the scope of part 11, with respect to records required to be 164 \r\nmaintained under predicate rules or submitted to FDA, when persons choose to use records in 165 \r\nelectronic format in place of paper format, part 11 would apply. On the other hand, when 166 \r\npersons use computers to generate paper printouts of electronic records, and those paper records 167 \r\nmeet all the requirements of the applicable predicate rules and persons rely on the paper records 168 \r\nto perform their regulated activities, FDA would generally not consider persons to be \"using 169 \r\nelectronic records in lieu of paper records\" under §§ 11.2(a) and 11.2(b). In these instances, the 170 \r\nuse of computer systems in the generation of paper records would not trigger part 11. 171 \r\n 172 \r\n2. Definition of Part 11 Records 173 \r\n 174 \r\nUnder this narrow interpretation, FDA considers part 11 to be applicable to the following records 175 \r\nor signatures in electronic format (part 11 records or signatures): 176 \r\n  177 \r\n• Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rule requirements and that are 178 \r\nmaintained in electronic format in place of paper format. On the other hand, records (and 179 \r\nany associated signatures) that are not required to be retained under predicate rules, but 180 \r\nthat are nonetheless maintained in electronic format, are not part 11 records. 181 \r\nWe recommend that you determine, based on the predicate rules, whether specific records 182 \r\nare part 11 records. We recommend that you document such decisions. 183 \r\n 184 \r\n• Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rules, that are maintained in 185 \r\nelectronic format in addition to paper format, and that are relied on to perform regulated 186 \r\nactivities. 187 \r\nIn some cases, actual business practices may dictate whether you are using electronic 188 \r\nrecords instead of paper records under § 11.2(a). For example, if a record is required to 189 \r\nbe maintained under a predicate rule and you use a computer to generate a paper printout 190 \r\nof the electronic records, but you nonetheless rely on the electronic record to perform 191 \r\nregulated activities, the Agency may consider you to be using the electronic record 192 \r\ninstead of the paper record. That is, the Agency may take your business practices into 193 \r\naccount in determining whether part 11 applies. 194 \r\nAccordingly, we recommend that, for each record required to be maintained under 195 \r\npredicate rules, you determine in advance whether you plan to rely on the electronic 196 \r\nrecord or paper record to perform regulated activities. We recommend that you 197 \r\ndocument this decision (e.g., in a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), or specification 198 \r\ndocument). 199 \r\n• Records submitted to FDA, under predicate rules (even if such records are not 200 \r\nspecifically identified in Agency regulations) in electronic format (assuming the records 201 \r\nhave been identified in docket number 92S-0251 as the types of submissions the Agency 202 \r\naccepts in electronic format).

You should also consider the impact those systems might have on the accuracy, 224 \r\nreliability, integrity, availability, and authenticity of required records and signatures. Even if 225 \r\nthere is no predicate rule requirement to validate a system, in some instances it may still be 226 \r\nimportant to validate the system. 227 \r\n 228 \r\nWe recommend that you base your approach on a justified and documented risk assessment and 229 \r\na determination of the potential of the system to affect product quality and safety, and record 230 \r\nintegrity. For instance, validation would not be important for a word processor used only to 231 \r\ngenerate SOPs. 232 \r\n 233 \r\nFor further guidance on validation of computerized systems, see FDA’s guidance for industry 234 \r\nand FDA staff General Principles of Software Validation and also industry guidance such as the 235 \r\nGAMP 4 Guide (See References). 236 \r\n 237 \r\n2.

If you cannot \r\nidentify the appropriate FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this \r\nguidance. I. Introduction \r\n This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., academia, other \r\nregulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking on the safety assessment of nanomaterials in \r\ncosmetic products. The guidance document is intended to assist industry and other \r\nstakeholders in identifying the potential safety issues of nanomaterials in cosmetic products \r\nand developing a framework for evaluating them. This guidance also provides contact \r\ninformation for manufacturers and sponsors who wish to discuss safety considerations \r\nregarding the use of specific nanomaterials in cosmetic products with FDA. This guidance is \r\nnot applicable to other products regulated by FDA, including over-the-counter and \r\nprescription drugs and medical devices. FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and \r\nshould be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory \r\nrequirements are cited. The use of the word “should” in our guidances means that \r\nsomething is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. Background \r\n \r\nNanomaterials are used in a variety of FDA-regulated products because of their unique \r\nproperties, imparting potential advantages to products considered for development. Such \r\nmaterials, due to their nanoscale size, can have chemical, physical, and biological properties \r\nthat differ from those of their larger counterparts. Such differences may include altered \r\nmagnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased structural integrity, or \r\naltered chemical or biological activity (Ref. 1). These new or altered properties may affect \r\nthe performance, quality, safety, and/or effectiveness, if applicable, of a product that \r\nincorporates that nanomaterial. 1  This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors in the Center for Food Safety and \r\nApplied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

The Task Force report presented an assessment of scientific and regulatory \r\nconsiderations relating to the safety and effectiveness of FDA-regulated products containing \r\nnanomaterials and made recommendations in light of these considerations (Ref. 2). Specifically, with respect to cosmetic products, the Task Force recommended that we issue \r\nguidance describing safety issues that manufacturers should consider to ensure that \r\ncosmetic products made with nanomaterials are safe and not adulterated. We are issuing \r\nthis guidance as part of our ongoing efforts to implement the Task Force recommendations \r\n(Ref. 2). The Task Force also recommended that FDA request submission of data and other \r\ninformation addressing the effects of nanomaterials in those products that are not subject to \r\npremarket authorization, such as cosmetic products. On September 8, 2008, FDA held a \r\npublic meeting to discuss such data and information, along with related scientific and \r\nregulatory issues concerning nanotechnology. FDA considered the information obtained at, \r\nand subsequent to, the public meeting in developing this guidance. We also considered \r\ninformation provided by the cosmetic industry to the International Cooperation on \r\nCosmetics Regulations (ICCR), publications and information regarding recent advances in \r\nnanotechnology, and other authoritative guidance/ reports regarding the safety of \r\nnanomaterials (Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6). This guidance also refers to other relevant reports, such as \r\nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Working Party on \r\nManufactured Nanomaterials “Preliminary Review of OECD Test Guidelines for their \r\nApplicability to Manufactured Nanomaterials” (Ref. 7), the Scientific Committee on \r\nConsumer Safety (SCCS) “Guidance on the Safety Assessment of Nanomaterials in \r\nCosmetics” (Ref. 8), and relevant ICCR reports, such as on the “Currently Available \r\nMethods for Characterization of Nanomaterials,” and “Principles of Cosmetic Product \r\nSafety Assessment. ” (Refs. 9, 10). FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,” \r\n“nanoscale,” or other related terms. In  June 2014, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled \r\n“Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of \r\nNanotechnology” (Ref. 1). As described in that guidance, at this time, when considering \r\nwhether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology, FDA will \r\nask: (1) whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external \r\ndimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to \r\n100 nm); and (2) whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or \r\nphenomena, including physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are \r\nattributable to its dimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up \r\nto one micrometer (1,000 nm). We will apply these considerations broadly to all FDA-\r\nregulated products, including cosmetic products. The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of \r\nconventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination. However, we do not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials or otherwise \r\ninvolving application of nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. Rather, for",

Our \r\nconsideration of nanotechnology applications in cosmetic products in this document is \r\nconsistent with the agency guidance (Ref. 1) and with the broader federal guidance on \r\nregulatory oversight of emerging technologies (Ref. 11) and nanotechnology (Ref. 12). III. Discussion \r\n  \r\nA. General Framework for Assessing the Safety of Nanomaterials \r\n in Cosmetic Products \r\n \r\nSection 301(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 331(a)) prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics2 in interstate \r\ncommerce. The FD&C Act does not subject cosmetics or cosmetic ingredients (with the \r\nexception of color additives) to FDA premarket approval in order to be marketed legally in \r\nthe United States. Except for color additives and those ingredients that are prohibited or \r\nrestricted from use in cosmetics by regulation, a manufacturer may use any ingredient in the \r\nformulation of a cosmetic provided that the use of the ingredient does not otherwise cause \r\nthe cosmetic to be adulterated (section 601 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 361)) or \r\nmisbranded (section 602 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 362)).3 \r\n \r\nCosmetic product manufacturers must ensure that the product is not misbranded or \r\nadulterated. The FD&C Act does not give us the authority to require that safety data be \r\nsubmitted to us or to approve a cosmetic product before it is marketed. Nevertheless, \r\nmanufacturers or distributors are responsible for obtaining all data and information needed \r\nto substantiate the safety of their products before introducing them into the marketplace. In the Federal Register of March 3, 1975 (40 FR 8912 at 8916), we advised that “the safety \r\nof a product can be adequately substantiated through (a) reliance on already available \r\ntoxicological test data on individual ingredients and on product formulations that are similar \r\nin composition to the particular cosmetic, and (b) performance of any additional \r\ntoxicological and other tests that are appropriate in light of such existing data and \r\ninformation. Although satisfactory toxicological data may exist for each ingredient of a \r\ncosmetic product, it will still be necessary to conduct some toxicological testing with the \r\ncomplete formulation to assure adequately the safety of the finished cosmetic. ” \r\n \r\nWe believe that these general principles are applicable to the safety substantiation of \r\ncosmetic products whether they contain nanomaterials or conventionally manufactured \r\n                                                           \r\n2 The FD&C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, \r\nsprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, \r\npromoting attractiveness or altering the appearance, and articles intended for use as a component of any such \r\narticles; except that such term shall not include soap” (section 201(i) of the FD&C Act). 3 The name of each ingredient must be declared on the label of the cosmetic product, as required by 21 CFR \r\n701.3.",

In applying these principles, however, it may be important to give particular \r\nconsideration to the fact that a material at nanoscale may show changes in, or have novel, \r\nphysicochemical properties, behaviors, and/or effects that could be different from a larger \r\nscale material with the same chemical composition (Refs. 2, 8). For example, the small particle size of a nanomaterial has the potential to alter the \r\ndistribution and bioavailability of that material compared to a larger scale material with the \r\nsame chemical composition. The small size leads to increased surface area relative to the \r\nmass of the particle, which could result in increased biological interactions. In addition, \r\nthe uptake, absorption, and biodistribution of the material may be altered, leading to \r\npotential systemic exposure (Refs. 5, 8). In some cases, the traditional testing methods that have been used to determine the safety \r\nof cosmetic ingredients and finished products may not be fully applicable due to a \r\nnanomaterial’s distinctive properties and behavior. Such distinctive physicochemical \r\ncharacteristics or biological interactions may affect the results or interpretation of results \r\nobtained from traditional toxicology testing, which form an integral part of safety \r\nsubstantiation. In Section III.B of this document, we highlight key scientific \r\nconsiderations relevant to the assessment of the safety of nanomaterials used in cosmetic \r\nproducts. If you wish to use a nanomaterial in a cosmetic product, either a new material or an \r\naltered version of an already marketed ingredient, we encourage you to meet with us to \r\ndiscuss the test methods and data that might help substantiate the product’s safety, \r\nincluding short-term toxicity and long-term toxicity data, as appropriate. We encourage \r\nyou to contact us to discuss any aspect of the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients or \r\nfinished products. B. Points to Consider in Assessing the Safety of Nanomaterials in \r\n Cosmetic Products \r\n \r\nWe consider the current framework for safety assessment sufficiently robust and flexible to \r\nbe appropriate for a variety of materials, including products containing nanomaterials. Just \r\nas the traditional safety assessment includes material characterization and toxicology \r\nconsiderations, safety evaluations of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials should also \r\ntake these considerations into account. As noted in section III.A, nanomaterials may exhibit \r\nnew or altered physicochemical properties that may affect biological interactions, which \r\nmay raise questions about the safety of the product containing nanomaterials. Any such \r\nunique properties or biological effects of nanomaterials should be identified and \r\nappropriately addressed during safety evaluations. With respect to nanomaterial characterization, safety should be assessed through fully \r\ndescribing the nanomaterial and evaluating a wide range of physical and chemical \r\nproperties, as well as through the assessment of impurities, if present. The toxicology and \r\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion considerations for nanomaterials in \r\ncosmetic products can be informed by addressing the routes of exposure, the uptake and",

In addition, any distinctive properties and biological \r\nbehavior of nanomaterials should be considered in determining the suitability of traditional \r\ntesting methods for toxicity testing of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials. As \r\nneeded, traditional toxicity testing methods should be modified or new methods developed \r\nto address: (1) the key chemical and physical properties that may affect the toxicity profile \r\nof nanomaterials and (2) the effects of those properties on the function of the cosmetic \r\nformulation. The toxicological testing should include consideration of toxicity of both the \r\ningredients and impurities; dosimetry for in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies, if needed; \r\nclinical testing, if warranted; and toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. The overall package of \r\ndata and information should substantiate the safety of the product under the intended \r\nconditions of use. These considerations are discussed in greater detail in sections III.B.1 and \r\nIII.B.2 below. 1. Nanomaterial Characterization \r\n \r\nNanomaterials vary widely in composition, morphology, and other characteristics and \r\ncannot be considered a uniform group of substances. These substances may have physical, \r\nchemical, or biological properties that are different from those of larger scale material with \r\nthe same chemical composition. As stated earlier, such differences may include altered \r\nmagnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased structural integrity, or \r\naltered chemical or biological activity (Ref. 6). As discussed in the FDA Task Force report, studies indicate that various attributes of a \r\nparticular nanoscale material, including increased surface-area-to-volume ratio, \r\nmorphology, surface features, and charge, can affect the distribution of that material in the \r\nbody and that material’s interaction with biological systems (Ref. 2, 8). Therefore, \r\nthorough characterization of nanomaterials can form an integral part of the safety \r\nassessment. This would include proper identification of the chemical composition as well \r\nas impurities, structure, and configuration of the nanomaterial(s) used in the cosmetic \r\nproduct. In addition, characterization of the nanomaterial(s) as present in the raw \r\nmaterial, formulation, test media, and in the relevant biological environment for \r\ntoxicological testing should be considered to help determine potential biological \r\ninteractions and effects (Ref. 8). In addition, stability of the nanomaterial under testing \r\nconditions and in a formulation under intended conditions of use should be determined. a. Physicochemical Properties \r\n \r\nAs with any cosmetic ingredient, the nanomaterial should be fully described, including: \r\n \r\n• the nanomaterial name, \r\n \r\n• the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number, \r\n \r\n• the structural formula, \r\n \r\n• the elemental and molecular composition including:",

A thorough understanding of the details of the manufacturing process will help identify \r\nresidual additives and impurities, as well as certain other physical and chemical properties. A wide range of physical and chemical properties should be evaluated to help determine if a \r\nsubstance produced with nanotechnology is safe for the proposed use (Refs. 7, 13, 14, 15). Proper characterization should include, as appropriate: \r\n \r\n• measurement of particle size and distribution, \r\n• aggregation and agglomeration characteristics, \r\n• surface chemistry, including: \r\no zeta potential/surface charge,  \r\no surface coating, \r\no functionalization, and \r\no catalytic activity \r\n• morphology including: \r\no shape, \r\no surface area, \r\no surface topology, and \r\no crystallinity \r\n• solubility, \r\n• density, \r\n• stability, and \r\n• porosity. Although a wide range of analytical techniques are available for measurement of \r\nphysicochemical properties of materials (Refs. 8, 9, 16), many of these methods have not \r\nbeen validated for the evaluation of nanomaterials in cosmetic products. Therefore, \r\nappropriate analytical methods suitable for the specific nanomaterial and the cosmetic \r\nproduct formulation should be chosen, and results obtained from such tests appropriately \r\ninterpreted and reported for adequate characterization of the material. b. Impurities \r\n \r\nAs with any cosmetic ingredient, a change in the starting material used to prepare a \r\nformulation will likely result in altered composition of the final product, which may result in \r\ndifferent impurities. Variables such as altered purity or changes in the starting material \r\nshould be considered. A manufacturer should assess the identity and quantity of impurities \r\nand how they may affect the overall safety of the end product. It is also important to understand how the nanomaterial is manufactured. Nanoscale \r\nimpurities may arise from the manufacturing process. Changes in the manufacturing",

Additional agents, such as dispersing agents and surface \r\nmodifiers, are often used in the manufacture of nanomaterials. These additional agents and \r\nimpurities should be considered in the safety substantiation for nanomaterials in cosmetic \r\nproducts. 2. Toxicology Considerations \r\n \r\nThe appropriateness of toxicological testing depends on the intended use, exposure levels, \r\nand degree of concern for potential toxicity of an ingredient or formulation. In determining \r\nwhat toxicological testing may be appropriate, manufacturers should consider each \r\ningredient’s chemical structure and composition, and physicochemical properties, \r\npurity/impurities, agglomeration and size distribution, stability, conditions of exposure, \r\nuptake and absorption, bioavailability, toxicity, and any other qualities that may affect the \r\nsafety of the product for its intended use. Manufacturers should address both short-term \r\nand long-term toxicity of nanomaterials (Ref. 8), and consider the need to evaluate the \r\npossibility of ingredient-ingredient interactions or ingredient-packaging interactions. Where traditional toxicity test methods are used, manufacturers should consider the \r\napplicability of the test methods and, as needed, modify them with respect to such factors as \r\nappropriate solvents and dosing formulations, solubility, agglomeration and aggregation of \r\nparticles, and stability conditions associated with the cosmetic product containing \r\nnanomaterials (Refs. 2, 17, 18). For example, whether a nanomaterial is soluble, insoluble, \r\nor partially-soluble may affect the suitability of a traditional toxicity test method. Some \r\ntraditional in vivo test methods may be suitable for only soluble nanomaterials (Ref. 17). Some traditional in vitro and in vivo test methods may need to be adjusted for testing \r\ninsoluble or partially-soluble nanomaterials (Refs. 7, 18). These considerations are \r\nimportant because nanoparticles tend to stick to each other to form larger \r\nagglomerates/aggregates that may be insoluble. Therefore, in a dosing or test medium, \r\nnanomaterials may be present as a nano-dispersion rather than in solution (Refs. 7, 18). Agglomeration and aggregation of particles is another factor that may affect the suitability \r\nof traditional toxicity testing methods, and manufacturers should ensure that testing \r\nappropriately reflects the range of free particles and any aggregates or aggolomerates found \r\nin the cosmetic product formulation. Toxicological testing may need to be conducted \r\nseparately on the free nanoparticles and the agglomerated/aggregated nanoparticles because \r\nthey will likely have different chemical and biological properties. Due to their high surface \r\nenergy, nanomaterials may also interact with the testing medium or bind to different \r\nsubstances, including proteins, in the test medium, resulting in an altered biological activity \r\n(Refs. 8, 19, 20, 21). Thus, manufacturers should consider and make necessary adjustments \r\nto traditional toxicity testing methods, taking into account the specific characteristics of the \r\nnanomaterial as it is intended to be used in the cosmetic product. In instances where \r\ntraditional toxicity testing methods cannot be satisfactorily modified, FDA recommends \r\ndeveloping new methods to adequately assess the toxicity of the nanomaterial in the \r\ncosmetic product and ensure the product is safe.",

In addition to \r\nweight/volume metrics, evaluations of the safety of nanomaterials should also consider \r\nalternative metrics, such as weight/volume concentration, particle number concentration and \r\nsurface area, until suitable parameters for dose metrics become available. a. Routes of Exposure \r\n \r\nThe safety of an ingredient is based in part on the potential for exposure and the relevant \r\nroutes of exposure that are determined by its intended use and its application. Although \r\nmost cosmetic products are applied directly to the skin, some products may be applied by \r\nspray presenting the possibility of inhalation exposure. Additionally, some cosmetic \r\nproducts are applied in an area where there is the possibility of oral exposure. Additionally, \r\nsystemic absorption can result from dermal, inhalation, ocular and oral exposures (Refs. 22, \r\n23). Therefore, for nanomaterials, the dose to the primary exposure organs as well as the \r\ndose to any secondary target organs should be considered in developing or modifying \r\ntoxicological testing methods and for evaluating the test data (Ref. 5). b. Uptake and Absorption \r\n \r\nAs stated above, some nanomaterials have unique physicochemical properties that may alter \r\nthe potential toxicity of a compound (e.g. reduction in particle size could increase the ability \r\nfor the compound to be absorbed). Therefore, the safety assessment should address whether \r\nthere will be an increase in uptake, absorption, transport into cells, and transport across \r\nbarriers (e.g. blood-brain barrier) or altered bioavailability or biological half-life. For \r\nexample, there may be an increase in the dose delivered to sensitive tissues due to the \r\nincreased ability of the nanomaterial to pass through the blood-brain barrier (Ref. 24). Nanomaterials used in cosmetic products can be divided into two groups: (1) soluble and/or \r\nbiodegradable nanoparticles, which disintegrate into their molecular components (e.g. some \r\nliposomes and nanoemulsions) upon application to skin and thus may not raise safety \r\nquestions, and (2) insoluble, sufficiently stable and/or biopersistent nanoparticles (e.g. titanium dioxide (TiO2), fullerenes, and quantum dots). Some insoluble, partially-soluble or \r\nsufficiently stable nanomaterials, particularly those in the lower nanoscale range and with \r\ncertain surface characteristics, may be able to cross biological membrane barriers (Ref. 25) \r\nand may have harmful effects due to the potential interaction with organs and cellular \r\ncompartments. Thus, when there is evidence of systemic exposure to nanomaterials, \r\nmanufacturers should consider including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion \r\n(ADME) parameters in safety assessments of the nanomaterial in the cosmetic product (Ref. 8). For exposure via dermal absorption, studies should be conducted with both intact skin and \r\nimpaired skin (e.g. sunburned, atopic, eczematous, psoriatic, or systematically damaged skin)",

The passive transport of many nanomaterials may not occur \r\nthrough intact skin, but there is an increased probability for entry of nanomaterials through \r\nskin with an impaired barrier layer (Refs. 26, 27). A variety of techniques used to study and \r\nquantify skin penetration of chemicals are discussed in the literature (Refs. 28, 29). We \r\nrecognize that there are limitations to using impaired skin models for conducting dermal \r\nabsorption studies as there is currently no standard or established method(s). We encourage \r\nmanufacturers to develop appropriate impaired skin models for dermal absorption studies. The use of aerosolized cosmetic products can also result in exposure to nanomaterials via \r\nthe respiratory tract. The deposition of nanomaterials in the respiratory system depends \r\non their aerosol properties and interactions with respiratory epithelium. The soluble \r\nnanoparticles may be dissolved, metabolized and transported to other organs and blood \r\nwhereas the insoluble nanoparticles may be either retained in the airways and result in \r\npulmonary effects or swallowed by coughing and cleared. As discussed earlier, the \r\nphysical characteristics, including surface properties of nanomaterials, are important \r\nfactors that warrant careful attention, particularly for inhaled nanoscale particles. Studies \r\nhave indicated that decreasing the size of particles and increasing the surface area can \r\nresult in potential adverse effects not only in the respiratory system, but also in the heart \r\nand blood vessels, the central nervous system, and the immune system (Ref. 30). Exposure via the oral route is generally limited to those products that are introduced into or \r\napplied near the mouth (e.g., mouthwash, lipsticks). Limited evidence suggests that the \r\nuptake of nanomaterials and systemic absorption depends on their size, surface charge, and \r\nsurface ligand modification (Ref. 30). Additional studies have indicated that nanomaterials \r\nhave limited uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, but the translocation to certain regions of \r\nthe intestinal barrier can be substantially increased (Refs. 31, 32). Therefore, we recommend that the safety assessment process for nanomaterials include the \r\nissues of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics with reference to different exposure routes. c. Toxicity Testing \r\n \r\nThe initial step in the evaluation of the safety assessment of cosmetic products is to \r\nconduct toxicity testing based on a toxicological profile of the ingredients and their routes \r\nof exposure. There are several guidelines (Refs. 4, 33, 34) for conducting toxicity testing \r\n(tiered testing strategy) of chemicals that can be used as a starting point in evaluating \r\ntoxicity of nanomaterial ingredients. Consistent with the guidelines issued by the \r\nCosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) (Ref. 33) and the Organization for \r\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Ref. 3), we recommend, at a \r\nminimum, testing for acute toxicity, skin irritation, ocular irritation, dermal photoirritation, \r\nskin sensitization, mutagenicity/ genotoxicity, repeated dose (21-28 days) toxicity, and \r\nsubchronic (90 days) toxicity (Ref. 34). We also recommend phototoxicity testing (Ref. 35) for a cosmetic product that is intended to be used on sun-exposed skin. Results \r\nobtained from this basic test battery may indicate a need for additional testing. Where \r\navailable, other relevant data, such as toxicological data on individual ingredients that are",

As stated previously, in designing tests for use with nanomaterials in cosmetics products, \r\nmanufacturers should consider modifying traditional toxicity testing with respect to such \r\nfactors as appropriate solvents and dosing formulations, agglomeration of particles, purity \r\nand stability conditions, and other variables. New methods may also need to be developed if \r\ntraditional tests cannot be modified satisfactorily. For example, the Ames test, \r\nrecommended as part of a battery of genotoxicity testing for conventional chemicals, may \r\nnot be suitable for insoluble or partially-soluble nanomaterials used in cosmetic products \r\nbecause the bacterial cell wall may create a possible barrier for many nanomaterials (Ref. 36). Toxicity testing in vivo has long been considered indispensable for obtaining information \r\non translocation, biodistribution, accumulation, and clearance (Ref. 37). As mentioned \r\nearlier, while conducting in vivo toxicity testing for nanomaterials, careful attention should \r\nbe paid to the issue of dose metrics (mass, volume or number of particles). The \r\nmanufacturer should consider the surface area and number of particles, as well as mass \r\nconcentration in the study design of in vivo toxicity testing. For in vivo studies via the \r\ndermal route of administration, the test substance should be applied directly to the skin, \r\nand for the oral route of administration, the test substance should be given either by gavage \r\nor in the diet. Agglomeration or aggregation characteristics of nanomaterials in the topical \r\nvehicle, gavage or feed matrix are other important factors to assess prior to conducting \r\nthese studies for safety assessment. Additionally, the potential for nanomaterials to \r\npenetrate through the skin or be absorbed through the gut and becoming available for \r\nbiodistribution, should be addressed while estimating the risks associated with the \r\nexposure to nanomaterials. There has been recent emphasis on the development of validated methods for in vitro \r\ntesting of cosmetic products by the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation \r\nof Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and the European Center for the Validation of \r\nAlternative Methods (ECVAM). The seventh amendment to Directive 2003/15/EC of the \r\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council (Ref. 38) instituted a ban on animal testing of \r\ncosmetic products in 2004 and a ban on certain animal tests with validated alternatives in \r\nMarch 2009. We recommend validation of in vitro methods for safety testing of cosmetic \r\nproducts and ingredients and optimizing these models for nanomaterials, with particular \r\nattention being paid to the issues of cytotoxicity and precipitation of insoluble ingredients. Nanomaterials can settle, diffuse, and aggregate differentially according to their size, \r\ndensity, and surface chemistry (Ref. 39). Thus, the assessment of the agglomeration or \r\naggregation of nanomaterials in the media used in the in vitro system should be addressed. Alternative testing methods currently under consideration that can be optimized for a \r\nspecific nanomaterial and might be useful to help determine ingredient safety include: \r\n \r\n1.

While \r\nconducting genotoxicty tests, the nanomaterial’s specific properties should \r\nbe taken into account to understand the mechanism of nanomaterials’ \r\ngenotoxic effects (Ref. 36). Finally, we note that in vivo studies may be more suitable for nanomaterials with limited \r\nsolubility properties (Ref. 8). C. Summary of Recommendations \r\n \r\nIn summary, nanomaterials can have chemical, physical, and biological properties that differ \r\nfrom those of larger scale particles with the same chemical composition, and the use of \r\nnanomaterials in cosmetic products may raise questions about the safety of the product for \r\nits intended use. As with any cosmetic product that has new or altered properties, data needs \r\nand testing methods should be evaluated to address any unique properties and function of the \r\nnanomaterials used in the cosmetic products as well as the questions that continue to remain \r\nabout the applicability of traditional safety testing methods to products that involve \r\nnanotechnology. We recommend that the safety assessment for cosmetic products using \r\nnanomaterials should address several important factors, including: \r\n \r\n• the physicochemical characteristics, \r\n• agglomeration and size distribution of nanomaterials under the conditions of \r\ntoxicity testing and as expected in the final product, \r\n• impurities, \r\n• potential routes of exposure to the nanomaterials,  \r\n• potential for aggregation and agglomeration of nanoparticles in the final product, \r\n• dosimetry for in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies, and \r\n• in vitro and in vivo toxicological data on nanomaterial ingredients and their \r\nimpurities, dermal penetration, potential inhalation, irritation (skin and eye) and \r\nsensitization studies, mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies. We expect that the science surrounding nanomaterials will continue to evolve and be used \r\nin the development of new testing methods. The safety of a cosmetic product should be evaluated by analyzing the physicochemical \r\nproperties and the relevant toxicological endpoints of each ingredient in relation to the \r\nexpected exposure resulting from the intended use of the finished product.

You can use an alternative \r\napproach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you \r\nwant to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for \r\nimplementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the \r\nappropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance. I. Why Are We Issuing This Guidance? The term “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) encompasses a wide \r\narray of health care practices, products, and therapies that are distinct from practices, \r\nproducts, and therapies used in “conventional” or “allopathic” medicine. Some forms of \r\nCAM, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, have been practiced \r\nfor centuries, whereas others, such as electrotherapy, are more recent in origin. In the United States, the practice of CAM has risen dramatically in recent years. In 1992, Congress established the Office of Unconventional Therapies, which later \r\nbecame the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), to explore “unconventional medical \r\npractices. ”  In 1998, OAM became the National Center for Complementary and \r\nAlternative Medicine (NCCAM). NCCAM is a center within the National Institutes of \r\nHealth. The Institute of Medicine, in its book entitled, Complementary and Alternative \r\nMedicine in the United States, stated that more than one-third of American adults \r\nreported using some form of CAM and that visits to CAM providers each year exceed \r\nthose to primary care physicians.2\r\n \r\nAs the practice of CAM has increased in the United States, the Food and Drug \r\nAdministration (“FDA”, “we”) has seen increased confusion as to whether certain \r\nproducts used in CAM (which, for convenience, we will refer to as “CAM products”) are \r\nsubject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“the Act”) or \r\nPublic Health Service Act (“PHS Act”). We have also seen an increase in the number of \r\nCAM products imported into the United States. Therefore, we are providing guidance as \r\n                                                           \r\n1   This guidance was prepared by the Office of Policy and Planning, Office of the Commissioner, Food and \r\nDrug Administration, with assistance from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center \r\nfor Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and the Center for \r\nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition. 2   See Institute of Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States, pages 34-35 \r\n(2005). 1",

          "text": "to when a CAM product is subject to the Act or the PHS Act.3  This guidance makes two \r\nfundamental points: \r\n! First, depending on the CAM therapy or practice, a product used in a \r\nCAM therapy or practice may be subject to regulation as a biological \r\nproduct, cosmetic, drug, device, or food (including food additives and \r\ndietary supplements) under the Act or the PHS Act. For example, the PHS \r\nAct defines “biological product,” and the Act defines (among other \r\nthings): \r\no Cosmetic; \r\no Device; \r\no Dietary supplement; \r\no Drug, as well as “new drug” and “new animal drug;” \r\no Food; and \r\no Food additive. These statutory definitions cover some CAM products. ! Second, neither the Act nor the PHS Act exempts CAM products from \r\nregulation. This means, for example, if a person decides to produce and \r\nsell raw vegetable juice for use in juice therapy to promote optimal health, \r\nthat product is a food subject to the requirements for  foods in the Act and \r\nFDA regulations, including the hazard analysis and critical control point \r\n(HACCP) system requirements for juices in 21 CFR part 120. If the juice \r\ntherapy is intended for use as part of a disease treatment regimen instead \r\nof for the general wellness, the vegetable juice would also be subject to \r\nregulation as a drug under the Act. We explain these two points in greater detail later in this document. II. What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)? NCCAM defines CAM as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems, \r\npractices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional \r\nmedicine.”4  It interprets “complementary” medicine as being used together with \r\nconventional medicine, whereas “alternative” medicine is used in place of conventional \r\nmedicine. NCCAM classifies CAM therapies into four categories or “domains. ”  These are: \r\n! Biologically-based practices;  \r\n! Energy therapies; \r\n                                                           \r\n3 When this guidance mentions a particular CAM therapy, practice, or product, it does so \r\nin order to provide background information or to serve as an example or illustration; any \r\nmention of a particular CAM therapy, practice, or product should not be construed as \r\nexpressing FDA’s support for or endorsement of that particular CAM therapy, practice, \r\nor product or, unless specified otherwise, as an agency determination that a particular \r\nproduct is safe and effective for its intended uses or is safe for use. 4   See NCCAM, “Get the FACTS – What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)? ” available \r\nat http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam (accessed on November 22, 2005). 2",

          "text": "! Manipulative and body-based methods; and \r\n! Mind-body medicine. NCCAM once had a fifth domain, “Alternative medical systems,” but now considers \r\n“alternative medical systems” (now known as “whole medical systems”) to be a separate \r\ncategory rather than another domain because alternative medical systems use practices \r\nfrom the four domains listed above. For purposes of this guidance, we adopt the same \r\ndomains and “whole medical systems” category that NCCAM uses. A. What Are “Biologically Based Practices? ” \r\n \r\nAccording to NCCAM, the domain called “biologically based practices” includes, \r\nbut is not limited to, botanicals, animal-derived extracts, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, \r\namino acids, proteins, prebiotics5 and probiotics,6 whole diets, and “functional foods”.7\r\n \r\n            Many biologically-based products within this domain are subject to statutory and \r\nregulatory requirements under the Act or the PHS Act. The intended use of a product \r\nplays a central role in how it is regulated. For example: \r\n \r\n! Botanical products, depending on the circumstances, may be regulated as \r\ndrugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, or foods.8  All four types of \r\n                                                           \r\n5   Prebiotics have been defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by \r\nselectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon (see \r\nGibson, G.R. and Roberfroid, M.B., “Dietary Modulation of the Human Colonic Microbiota: Introducing \r\nthe Concept of Prebiotics,” Journal of Nutrition, 125: 1401-1412 (1995)). Oligosaccharides are commonly \r\nused as prebiotics. 6   “Probiotics” have been defined as live microbial food supplements which beneficially affect the host \r\nanimal by improving its intestinal microbial balance (see Fuller, R., “Probiotics in Man and Animals,” \r\nJournal of Applied Bacteriology, 66: 365-378 (1989)) and as live microorganisms which, when consumed \r\nin adequate amounts of food, confer a health benefit on the host (see Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nand World Health Organization, “Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food including Powder \r\nMilk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria” (1-4 October 2001)). For purposes of this document, we will \r\nconsider probiotics to refer to whole, live microorganisms that are ingested with the intention of providing \r\na health benefit (such as supporting digestion and nutrient adsorption in the intestine). Our Center for Food \r\nSafety and Applied Nutrition, simply refers to such bacteria as “live microorganisms. ”   \r\n              “Probiotics” are not defined as a regulatory product category under the Act or the PHS Act, and \r\nproducts that may be considered to be “probiotics” may be foods or drugs under the Act, depending on the \r\nintended use of the product. 7   See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Biologically Based Practices: An Overview” (October 2004), at \r\npage 1 (available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/biobasedprac.pdf) (accessed on November \r\n22, 2005)). NCCAM interprets “functional foods” as “components of the usual diet that may have \r\nbiologically active components (e.g., polyphenols, phytoestrogens, fish oils, carotenoids) that may provide \r\nhealth benefits beyond basic nutrition” (id. at page 3). However, “functional foods” are not defined as a \r\nregulatory product category, and products that NCCAM would interpret to be “functional foods” would \r\neither be foods or drugs to FDA, depending on the claims associated with the product. 8   Although dietary supplements are a type of food (see section 201(ff) of the Act (last sentence)), for ease \r\nof reference, we will use the term “food” to refer to foods other than dietary supplements (e.g., \r\nconventional foods, food additives, or GRAS substances intended for use in food)  throughout the \r\nremainder of this guidance. We may discuss specific types of “foods,” such as “food additives,” separately \r\n 3",

          "text": "products are subject to the Act. For example, a botanical product intended \r\nfor use in treating a disease would generally be regulated as a drug; a \r\nbotanical product taken by mouth, labeled as a dietary supplement, and \r\nintended for use to affect the structure or function of the body would \r\ngenerally be regulated as a dietary supplement; a raw or dried botanical \r\nintended for use as an ingredient to flavor food would generally be \r\nregulated as a food or as a food additive, depending on whether the \r\nbotanical was generally recognized as safe for its intended use in food; and \r\na lotion containing botanical ingredients and intended for use in \r\nmoisturizing the skin would generally be regulated as a cosmetic. ! Probiotics may be regulated as dietary supplements, foods, or drugs under \r\nthe Act, depending on the product’s intended use. Other factors may also \r\naffect the classification of the product, e.g., whether the product contains a \r\n“dietary ingredient” as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)), whether it is represented as a conventional food or as a meal \r\nreplacement (see section 201(ff)(2)(B) of the Act), and, for probiotics used \r\nas  ingredients in a conventional food, whether the ingredient is generally \r\nrecognized as safe for its intended use (see section 201(s) of the Act (21 \r\nU.S.C. 321(s)). In addition to any requirements that apply based on the \r\nproduct’s classification under the Act, probiotics may also be subject to \r\nthe PHS Act’s provisions concerning the prevention of communicable \r\ndisease, due to potential disease-causing microorganisms that might be \r\ncontained in such products. Finally, if a probiotic is a drug under the Act, \r\nit may be subject to regulation as a biological product under the PHS Act \r\nas well. ! Products that NCCAM would consider to be “functional foods” may be \r\nsubject to FDA regulation as foods, dietary supplements, or drugs under \r\nthe Act. As with botanicals and probiotics, the classification of a \r\n“functional food” under the Act is based primarily on the product’s \r\nintended use and may also involve other factors, depending on the \r\nelements of the statutory definition of a particular product category. B. What Is “Energy Medicine? ” \r\n \r\nNCCAM considers energy medicine to involve energy fields of two types: \r\n! Veritable energy fields, which can be measured and use either mechanical \r\nvibrations (such as sound) or electromagnetic forces, including visible \r\nlight, magnetism, monochromatic radiation (such as laser light), and other \r\nlight rays; and \r\n! Putative energy fields (or biofields) that have defied measurement to date \r\nby reproducible methods. According to NCCAM, therapies involving \r\nputative energy fields “are based on the concept that human beings are \r\n                                                                                                                                                                             \r\nto explain additional statutory or regulatory requirements or concepts, but those products are still “foods” \r\nunder the Act. 4",

For example, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device uses \r\nelectromagnetic waves to create images of internal body organs and tissues. As another \r\nexample, an ultrasound machine uses sound waves to create images of body organs, \r\ntissues, and fetuses. Given their intended uses, we regulate these products as medical \r\ndevices under the Act. CAM products that use veritable energy fields in the diagnosis of disease or other \r\nconditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or \r\nanimals or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals may be \r\nmedical devices under the Act.10  Additionally, if the product is electronic and emits \r\nradiation, it may be subject to additional requirements to ensure that there is no \r\nunnecessary exposure of people to radiation. CAM products that use putative energy fields in the diagnosis of disease or other \r\nconditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or \r\nanimals may be medical devices under the Act. For example, we regulate acupuncture \r\nneedles as “class II” medical devices.11   \r\n \r\n \r\nC. What Are “Manipulative and Body-Based Practices? ” \r\n \r\nAccording to NCCAM:  \r\n \r\nUnder the umbrella of manipulative and body-based practices is a heterogeneous \r\ngroup of CAM interventions and therapies. These include chiropractic and \r\nosteopathic manipulation, massage therapy, Tui Na, reflexology, rolfing, Brown \r\ntechnique, Trager bodywork, Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method, and a \r\nhost of others.... Manipulative and body-based practices focus primarily on the structures and \r\nsystems of the body, including the bones and joints, the soft tissues, and the \r\ncirculatory and lymphatic systems....12\r\n \r\n            To the extent that manipulative and body-based practices involve practitioners \r\nphysically manipulating a patient’s body, without using tools or machines, we do not \r\n                                                           \r\n9   See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER – Energy Medicine: An Overview (August 2005), at page 1 \r\n(available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.pdf) (accessed on November 22, 2005). 10   See section 201(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)(2) and (h)(3)) (definition of “device”). 11   See 21 CFR 880.5580. 12   See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Manipulative and Body-Based Practices: An Overview” \r\n(December 2004), at page 1 (available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/manipulative.pdf) \r\n(accessed on November 22, 2005). 5",

D. What Is “Mind-Body Medicine? ” \r\n \r\n            NCCAM describes mind-body medicine as focusing on “the interactions among \r\nthe brain, mind, body, and behavior, and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, \r\nsocial, spiritual, and behavioral factors can directly affect health.”13  It states that mind-\r\nbody medicine “typically focuses on intervention strategies that are thought to promote \r\nhealth, such as relaxation, hypnosis, visual imagery, meditation, yoga, biofeedback, tai \r\nchi, qi gong, cognitive-behavioral therapies, group support, autogenic training, and \r\nspirituality.”14   \r\n \r\n            In general, CAM practices in this domain would not be subject to our jurisdiction \r\nunder the Act or the PHS Act.

For example, biofeedback machines intended to help a patient learn \r\nto affect body functions, such as muscle activity, are regulated as class II devices.15\r\n \r\n \r\nE. What Are “Whole Medical Systems? ” \r\n \r\nNCCAM describes whole medical systems as involving “complete systems of \r\ntheory and practice that have evolved independently from or parallel to allopathic \r\n(conventional) medicine.”16  These may reflect individual cultural systems, such as \r\ntraditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Some elements common to whole \r\nmedical systems are a belief that the body has the power to heal itself, and that healing \r\nmay involve techniques that use the mind, body, and spirit. Although it is unlikely that a whole medical system itself would be subject to \r\nregulation under the Act or the PHS Act, products used as components of whole medical \r\nsystems may be subject to FDA regulation for the reasons described above. 13   See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Mind-Body Medicine: An Overview” (August 2005), at page 1 \r\n(available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/mindbody.pdf) (accessed on November 22, 2005). 14   Id. 15   See 21 CFR 882.5050. 16   See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Whole Medical Systems: An Overview” (October 2004), at page \r\n1 (available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/wholemed.pdf) (accessed on November 22, 2005). 6",

          "text": "III. How Do CAM Domains Relate to Products That We Regulate? Given the vast array of CAM products, practices, and therapies, it is impractical \r\nfor us to describe in detail how each one might be subject to regulation under the Act or \r\nthe PHS Act. Our intent, in part IV of this document, is two-fold: \r\n! To indicate which CAM domains might be subject to regulation under the \r\nAct or the PHS Act; and  \r\n! To show that neither the Act nor the PHS Act contains any exemption for \r\nCAM products. In other words, if a product meets the statutory definition \r\nof drug, device, biological product, food, etc., it will be subject to \r\nregulation under the Act and/or the PHS Act. IV. What FDA Authority Might Apply to CAM Products? A. What Statutory Definitions Might Apply? To understand how the Act or the PHS Act might apply to CAM products, we \r\nbegin by understanding the Act’s statutory definitions or, in the case of the PHS Act, our \r\nauthority regarding biological products. 1. “Drug” and “New Drug” \r\n \r\nSection 201(g)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) defines the term “drug,” in \r\nrelevant part, to mean: \r\n \r\n(A) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official \r\nHomeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, \r\nor any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the \r\ndiagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other \r\nanimals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any \r\nfunction of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as \r\na component of any articles specified in clause (A), (B), or (C). Section 201(p) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) defines the term “new drug” to \r\nmean: \r\n \r\n(1) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal feed bearing or \r\ncontaining a new animal drug) the composition of which is such that the drug is \r\nnot generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and \r\nexperience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and \r\neffective17 for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in \r\n                                                           \r\n17   In Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott and Dunning, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2483 (1973), the Supreme Court stated \r\nthat “general recognition” of effectiveness “requires at least ‘substantial evidence’ of effectiveness for \r\napproval” of a new drug application (NDA).

To illustrate how these definitions might apply, consider an herbal product that is \r\nintended to treat arthritis in humans. The herbal product, which would be a “biologically \r\nbased practice” insofar as CAM domains are concerned, would be a “drug” under section \r\n201(g)(1)(B) of the Act because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, \r\ntreatment, or prevention of disease (arthritis) in man. The same herbal product would \r\nalso be a “new drug” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act unless it is generally recognized, \r\namong experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and \r\neffectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, \r\nrecommended, or suggested in the labeling. “New drug” status triggers the Act’s \r\nrequirements for premarket review and approval by FDA.18  \r\n \r\n            A detailed discussion of the Act’s drug provisions is beyond the scope of this \r\nguidance document. Note, however, that the Act imposes certain requirements (including \r\nrequirements pertaining to establishment registration and product listing, pre-market \r\napproval, labeling, postmarket reporting, and good manufacturing practices) on those \r\nwho manufacture and distribute drugs. The Act and our drug regulations can be found at \r\nour website at http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws. 2. “Device” \r\n \r\n            In general, section 201(h) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)) defines the term “device” \r\nas: \r\n \r\nan instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro \r\nreagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or \r\naccessory  which is –  \r\n                                                                                                                                                                             \r\nSection 505(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)) defines “substantial evidence” as “evidence consisting of \r\nadequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations conducted by experts \r\nqualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the \r\nbasis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the \r\neffect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or \r\nsuggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. ”  Thus, “general recognition” is a high standard. 18   Under section 505(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 355(a)), “No person shall introduce or deliver for \r\nintroduction into interstate commerce any new drug, unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to \r\n[section 505(b) or 505(j) of the Act] is effective with respect to such drug. ” \r\n 8",

To illustrate how a CAM product might be a “device” under the Act, acupuncture \r\nis a CAM therapy that seeks to stimulate energy pathways (“meridians”) by puncturing, \r\npressing, heating, using electrical current, or using herbal medicines. Fine needles are \r\noften used, and these acupuncture needles are “devices” under section 201(h) of the Act \r\nbecause they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of \r\ndisease in man or are intended to affect the structure or function of the body of man. We \r\nregulate acupuncture needles (see 21 CFR 880.5580), but not the practice of acupuncture \r\nitself. A detailed discussion of the Act’s device provisions is beyond the scope of this \r\nguidance document. Note, however, that the Act establishes classifications for devices \r\n(class I, II, or III) that affect how they are regulated. The Act also imposes certain \r\nrequirements on those who manufacture devices (including requirements pertaining to \r\nestablishment registration and product listing, pre-market review, labeling, postmarket \r\nreporting, and good manufacturing practices).

To illustrate how a CAM practice might involve “foods,” juice therapy uses juice \r\nmade from vegetables and fruits. Absent any claims that would make the juice subject to \r\nthe drug definition, the juice would be a “food” under section 201(f) of the Act because it \r\nis an article used for food or drink for man. A detailed discussion of the Act’s food provisions is beyond the scope of this \r\nguidance document. However, anyone who intends to market CAM products that might \r\nbe subject to regulation under these provisions should familiarize himself/herself with the \r\nAct’s requirements for foods, particularly with respect to safety and labeling.

If a manufacturer adds such \r\na substance to a food, the substance may fall within the “food additive” definition at \r\nsection 201(s) of the Act. A food additive is subject to premarket approval by FDA \r\nunder section 409 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348). Food additives that we have not approved \r\nor that do not comply with applicable FDA regulations prescribing safe conditions of use \r\nare deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act, and foods that contain such \r\nadditives are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)). The Act provides that a substance is exempt from the definition of a food additive and \r\nthus, from pre-market approval, if, among other reasons, it is generally recognized as safe \r\n(GRAS) by qualified experts under the conditions of intended use. Whether a substance \r\nadded to a food is considered to be a food additive or is GRAS, any claims associating \r\nthe substance with the reduction of a disease risk are “health claims” (defined in 21 CFR \r\n101.14(a)(1)) that require premarket review by FDA.20\r\n \r\n            A detailed discussion of the Act’s food additive provisions is beyond the scope of \r\nthis guidance document. However, anyone intending to market CAM products that are or \r\ncontain substances that might be subject to regulation as food additives should familiarize \r\nhimself/herself with the Act’s food additive requirements. The Act and our food additive \r\nregulations can be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws. 5. “Dietary Supplement” \r\n \r\nSection 201(ff) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)) defines the term “dietary \r\nsupplement” as follows:  \r\n \r\nThe term “dietary supplement” -  \r\n                                                           \r\n19   The statutory definition of “food additive” exempts certain substances, such as pesticide chemical \r\nresidues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, pesticide chemicals, color additives, \r\ndietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement (as defined in section 201(ff) of the Act), \r\nand new animal drugs. 20  See 21 CFR 101.70. 10",

In this example, the \r\ncranberry tablets generally would be regulated as “dietary supplements” under section \r\n201(ff)(1) of the Act if they were labeled for use to “maintain the health of the urinary \r\ntract” rather than “prevent urinary tract infections. ”  The cranberry tablets would be \r\nregulated as “drugs” under section 201(g) of the Act if they were labeled for use to “treat \r\nurinary tract infections” even if they were labeled as dietary supplements. A detailed discussion of the Act’s dietary supplement provisions is beyond the \r\nscope of this guidance document. However, anyone intending to market CAM products \r\nthat might be subject to regulation as a dietary supplement should familiarize \r\nhimself/herself with the Act’s dietary supplement requirements, particularly with respect \r\nto safety and labeling. The Act and our dietary supplement regulations can be found at \r\nour website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws. 6. “Cosmetic” \r\n \r\n            Section 201(i) of the Act defines the term “cosmetic” to mean “(1) articles \r\nintended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise \r\napplied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting \r\nattractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component \r\nof any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap. ” \r\n \r\n            It is possible that certain products used in conjunction with CAM practices may \r\nbe “cosmetics” under the Act. For example, if a CAM practice involves massage with a \r\nmoisturizer, the moisturizer could be a “cosmetic” to the extent that it is “rubbed, poured, \r\nsprinkled, or sprayed on” the body for beautification or appearance-altering purposes. However, if the moisturizer’s intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, \r\ntreatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body, \r\nthen it may also be subject to regulation as a drug. Other examples of drug/cosmetic \r\ncombinations are deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup \r\nmarketed with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that also treat dandruff. The Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit \r\nthe marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. Anyone \r\nintending to market CAM products that might be subject to regulation as cosmetics \r\nshould familiarize himself/herself with the safety and labeling requirements for these \r\nproducts in the Act and our regulations.

Section 351(a)(2) of the PHS Act gives us the authority to establish requirements for the \r\napproval, suspension, and revocation of biological product licenses. Section 351(i) of the PHS Act defines “biological product” as “a virus, \r\ntherapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, \r\nallergenic product, or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine \r\n(or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, \r\ntreatment, or cure of a disease or condition in human beings. ”  The term “virus” captures \r\na broad spectrum of microorganisms that cause an infectious disease and includes, but is \r\nnot limited to, filterable viruses, bacteria, rickettsia, fungi, and protozoa (see 21 CFR \r\n600.3(h)(1)). It is conceivable that some “biologically based practices” (as defined by \r\nNCCAM) could involve the use of “biological products” as defined by section 351(i) of \r\nthe PHS Act. For example, the bacteria used in a probiotic product could make the \r\nproduct a “biological product” subject to the PHS Act. A detailed discussion of biological product regulation under the PHS Act is \r\nbeyond the scope of this guidance document. Note, however, that in addition to our \r\nauthority under section 351 of the PHS Act, section 361 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264) \r\nauthorizes us to make and enforce regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, \r\nor spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, \r\nor from one State or possession into any other State or possession. ”  If a CAM product \r\nmanufacturer attempted to use a live, disease-causing virus as a component of a CAM \r\nproduct, we could exercise our authority under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR \r\n1240.30 to take action against the product, in addition to consider the applicability of \r\nsection 351 of the PHS Act. The PHS Act and FDA’s regulations for biological products \r\ncan be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws. V. Whom Do You Contact For More Information?

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind \r\nFDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the \r\nrequirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative \r\napproach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot \r\nidentify the appropriate FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this \r\nguidance. I. Introduction\r\nThis document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., consumer interest \r\ngroups, academia, other regulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking concerning what \r\nconstitutes Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for cosmetics. It is intended to assist industry \r\nand other stakeholders in identifying the standards and issues that can affect the quality of \r\ncosmetic products. This guidance revises the “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection \r\nChecklist” by updating it to set forth current practice, and clarify certain topic areas based on \r\nrecent experience. In addition, as part of an international harmonization effort with the \r\nInternational Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulations (ICCR), FDA (or we) agreed to consider the \r\ncurrent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO \r\n22716:2007) when revising this guidance. We reviewed ISO 22716 and decided to incorporate, \r\nmodify, or exclude specific aspects of it into this guidance based on our experience. FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \r\nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. Background\r\nThe predecessor to this guidance, FDA’s “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Guidelines/Inspection \r\nChecklist,” was based on documents and information dating before the early 1990’s. Much of \r\nthe material in the predecessor document has become outdated.

ISO 22716:2007. Geneva, Switzerland:ISO.). ISO is a non-governmental organization that develops and publishes international consensus \r\nstandards. In September 2007, the International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation (ICCR), \r\nthe quadrilateral international harmonization group, met in Belgium. During that meeting, the \r\nregulators from the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Japan agreed that it would \r\nbe useful for the cosmetic industry to have a standardized scheme for GMPs that could apply to \r\ntheir jurisdictions. As a result, the regulators from these four jurisdictions agreed to take ISO \r\nstandards for cosmetic GMPs into consideration when developing or updating guidelines or other \r\nmeasures addressing GMPs (See International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation: Outcome of \r\nMeeting, September 26-28, 2007). In developing this guidance, FDA has incorporated elements \r\nof ISO 22716, as appropriate, and consistent with FDA regulations. III. Discussion \r\n \r\nA. Overview \r\n \r\nThe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) prohibits the introduction, or \r\ndelivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of cosmetics that are adulterated or \r\nmisbranded (Section 301 of the FD&C Act). If you manufacture cosmetics, you can reduce the risk of adulterating or misbranding cosmetics \r\nby following the GMP recommendations in this guidance. By following these recommendations, \r\nyou can effectively conduct a self-inspection to rate your operations. Tampering and other malicious, criminal, or terrorist activity present additional risks that can \r\nalso have a direct impact on your products’ quality. To help minimize these risks to cosmetics \r\nunder your control, we recommend that you consult a separate FDA guidance document entitled \r\n“Guidance for Industry:  Cosmetic Processors and Transporters of Cosmetics Security Preventive \r\nMeasures Guidance. ”   \r\n \r\nB. Definitions \r\n \r\nWe recommend that you refer to the FD&C Act and Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations \r\n(21 CFR) for definitions of the terms “cosmetic” (Section 201(i) of the FD&C Act) and “tamper-\r\nresistant packaging” (21 CFR 700.25). In addition, the following terms apply to this guidance:  \r\n \r\nDocumentation: 1) The supplying of documents or supporting references; use of documentary \r\nevidence; 2) the documents or references thus supplied; 3) the collecting, abstracting, and coding \r\nof printed or written information for future reference.

It is thus \r\nconcerned with both manufacturing and quality control procedures. (Sharp, John, Good \r\nManufacturing Practice, Philosophy and Applications, Buffalo Grove, IL: Interpharm Press, \r\n1991, pg. 47.). Internal Audit:  Systematic and independent examination made by competent personnel inside \r\nthe company, the aim of which is to determine whether activities covered by these guidelines and \r\nrelated results comply with planned arrangements and whether these arrangements are \r\nimplemented effectively and are suitable for achieving objectives. (Cosmetics – Good \r\nManufacturing Practices (GMP) – Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, ISO \r\n22716:2007, Geneva, Switzerland: ISO.). Standard operating procedure (SOP):  Instructions on how to perform tasks and descriptions \r\nof the approved or required procedures for accomplishing specific quality assurance objectives.

Specific Guidance for Cosmetics2 \r\n \r\nDocumentation \r\n \r\nDocumentation creates a mechanism that shows how products are manufactured and tested. Documentation should define your organization’s processes and capture every aspect of your \r\nmanufacturing process. Documentation prevents errors of interpretation or loss of information \r\nthat may result from reliance on verbal communication. Documentation also allows you to trace \r\nwhere any problems may have occurred and to take appropriate corrective action. Records \r\n \r\nRecords should be retained in either paper or electronic format. Records should capture in detail \r\nthe operations, procedures, deviations from procedures, justifications, instructions (including \r\ntraining), specifications, protocols, reports, methods, precautions, corrections and other measures, \r\nand other appropriate information related to GMPs. You should review raw material records to determine if raw material is adequately controlled. These records may include origin, receipt, examination, testing, disposition, and use records. You should determine whether disposition of rejected materials or returned goods is documented. (For example, reworking operations, returns to suppliers, and disposals). You should evaluate batch production control records, which should include: \r\n                                            \r\n2 There are no GMP regulations for cosmetics.",

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA \r\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable \r\nstatutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible \r\nfor this guidance as listed on the title page. I. Introduction \r\n \r\nThis guidance provides recommendations and instructions to assist persons submitting cosmetic \r\nproduct facility registrations and product listings to FDA. This guidance document explains, \r\namong other things: \r\n \r\n• The statutory requirement to submit cosmetic product facility registrations and product \r\nlistings;  \r\n• Definitions;  \r\n• Who is responsible for making the submissions;  \r\n• What information to include in the submissions; \r\n• How to make the submissions; and \r\n• When to make the submissions. FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \r\nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. Background \r\n \r\nOn December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Pub. L. 117-328) into law, which included the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 \r\n(MoCRA). Among other provisions, MoCRA added section 607 to the Federal Food, Drug, and \r\nCosmetic Act (FD&C Act), establishing requirements for cosmetic product facility registration \r\nand product listing. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors, in the Center for Food Safety and Applied \r\nNutrition, and the Office of the Chief Scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\n \r\n \r\n 4 \r\n \r\nSection 607(a) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility that \r\n“engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United \r\nStates” to register each facility with FDA. Section 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible person \r\nmust submit to FDA “a cosmetic product listing. ” \r\n \r\nFDA previously had a voluntary cosmetic registration program (see 21 CFR Parts 710 and 720). FDA ended its voluntary registration program as of March 27, 2023, while we worked toward \r\nestablishing a new system, including a submission portal for the cosmetic product facility \r\nregistrations and product listings mandated by MoCRA.2 Information in the voluntary cosmetic \r\nregistration program will not be transferred to this new system. Because the information in the \r\nvoluntary cosmetic registration program differs from the information required to be submitted \r\nunder MoCRA, FDA does not consider previous submissions to the voluntary cosmetic \r\nregistration program to satisfy the registration and listing requirements mandated by MoCRA. FDA has developed an electronic submission portal, Cosmetics Direct, to help streamline \r\nsubmission and receipt of registration and product listing information under section 607 of the \r\nFD&C Act. FDA has developed paper forms (FDA Form 5066 and 5067) as an alternative \r\nsubmission tool. As an additional alternative, users may transmit submissions through FDA’s \r\nElectronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) as described in section III.E. below. FDA strongly \r\nencourages electronic submissions to facilitate efficiency and timeliness of data submission and \r\nmanagement for the agency. Cosmetics Direct, technical assistance documents and paper \r\nsubmission forms can be accessed at: https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-\r\ncosmetic-product-facilities-and-products. Certain small businesses, as defined in section 612 of the FD&C Act, are not required to register \r\nfacilities and list cosmetic product(s) (refer to section III.A. and III.B. below). Failure to register or submit listing information in accordance with section 607 of the FD&C Act \r\nis a prohibited act under section 301(hhh) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(hhh)). III. Questions and Answers \r\n \r\nA. What definitions apply? We plan to use the following definitions in implementing the registration and product listing \r\nrequirements of section 607 of the FD&C Act: \r\n \r\n \r\n2 For more information, refer to FDA’s Constituent Update “FDA Has Stopped Accepting Submissions to the \r\nVoluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)” at: https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-has-\r\nstopped-accepting-submissions-voluntary-cosmetic-registration-program-vcrp.",

B. Who registers a facility and submits product listing information under \r\nsection 607 of the FD&C Act? 1. Registration of a Facility \r\nSection 607(a)(1) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility that \r\nengages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the \r\nUnited States to register each facility, except in the following instances: \r\n \r\n• A facility that is exempt from registration as a “small business” as described section \r\nIII.A. above; \r\n• A facility that is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for \r\ndrugs and devices) unless the facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic \r\nproducts that are not subject to the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act (see \r\nsection 613 of the FD&C Act). As provided under section 607(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, if a facility manufactures or processes \r\ncosmetic products on behalf of a responsible person (i.e., a contract manufacturer), only a \r\nsingle registration is required for such facility even if the facility is manufacturing or \r\nprocessing its own cosmetic products or cosmetic products on behalf of more than one \r\nresponsible person. A responsible person whose products are manufactured or processed at \r\nsuch facility may submit the facility registration for such facility. Under this approach, an \r\nowner or operator of a contract manufacturing facility would not register such facility if the \r\nresponsible person submitted the facility registration. 2. Product Listing \r\nSection 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible \r\nperson must submit a cosmetic product listing, or ensure such submission is made, except in \r\nthe following instances: \r\n \r\n• The responsible person that is exempt as a “small business” as described in section \r\nIII.A. above; \r\n• The cosmetic product that is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the \r\nFD&C Act (for drugs and devices). For example, if the product is both a drug and a \r\ncosmetic product under the FD&C Act, a cosmetic product listing is not required to \r\nbe submitted for such product (see section 613 of the FD&C Act), but the listed \r\nproduct should be identified as both a drug and a cosmetic in the drug listing \r\nsubmission.",

Obtaining the assigned facility registration number is the first step before starting the \r\nregistration submission. FDA also requests that the following additional optional information be submitted: \r\n \r\n4 With respect to a foreign facility, a United States agent (“U.S. agent”) is required for registration purposes. The \r\nU.S. agent is the person, which includes an individual or business entity, that resides in the U.S. or maintains a U.S. place of business and is physically present in the U.S. A U.S. agent should not be a mailbox, answering machine or \r\nservice, or other place where an individual acting as the foreign facility’s agent is not physically present. 5 The facility registration number is the FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI). To facilitate the registration process, \r\nthe owner or operator of a facility will need to obtain an FEI number before submitting the facility registration. Request for issuance of FEI numbers associated with registration for cosmetic product facilities are typically \r\nprocessed in 7-10 business days. A facility that was previously assigned an FEI number in connection with other \r\nbusiness with FDA should use the same FEI number and should not request a new FEI. For more information, \r\nincluding how to determine if an entity already has an FEI number, refer to the webpage at: \r\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/feiportal/index.cfm?action=portal.login. If your entity does not have an FEI \r\nnumber assigned by FDA, send a request to feiportal@fda.hhs.gov and provide the following information: \r\n• Legal firm name \r\n• Any alternate firm names, including those used for \"doing business as\" purposes \r\n• Physical address \r\n• Designated mailing address \r\n• Name and contact information of the designated contact person \r\n• A comprehensive list of activities conducted at this specific location (e.g., drug manufacturing, food \r\npackaging, etc. ) \r\n• Any registration numbers associated with other FDA Center(s), if applicable \r\n• Any former names the firm was known by \r\n• Any previous addresses linked to the firm",

Technical assistance will be available for users by contacting a help desk for \r\nCosmetics Direct. As an alternative, users may transmit SPL-formatted submissions through FDA’s Electronic \r\nSubmissions Gateway (ESG),9 or any SPL authoring software including Xforms.10 The FDA \r\nESG system requires users to apply for a free account before submitting data, a process which \r\ncan take one to three weeks.

Both the Cosmetics Direct and the paper forms are accessible at \r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products. F. When must you register and list under section 607 of the FD&C Act? 1. Registration \r\n \r\na. Initial Registration \r\nEvery person that, on December 29, 2022, owns or operates a facility that engages in the \r\nmanufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United States \r\nmust register each facility no later than December 29, 2023 (section 607(a)(1)(A) of the \r\nFD&C Act). Every person that owns or operates a facility that first engages, after December 29, 2022, \r\nin manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United States, \r\nmust register such facility within 60 days of first engaging in such activity or by February \r\n27, 2024, whichever is later (section 607(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Note: On November 8, 2023, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Compliance \r\nPolicy for Cosmetic Product Facility Registration and Cosmetic Product Listing. ” This \r\nguidance explains that FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section \r\n607 of the FD&C Act related to cosmetic product facility registration until July 1, 2024. b. Amended Registration \r\nEvery person who is required to register must update their registration within 60 days of \r\nany changes to the information required for registration (section 607(a)(4) of the FD&C \r\nAct) (an “amended” registration). This includes any changes that result in cancellation of \r\nthe registration. c. Renewal of Registration \r\nEvery person who is required to register a facility must renew such registration biennially \r\n(i.e., every two years) (section 607(a)(2) of the FD&C Act). FDA is providing for an abbreviated renewal of registrations when there have not been \r\nany updates to the registration since the most recent facility registration submission, as \r\nrequired under section 607(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Note:  In the case of a contract manufacturer, a facility registration may be submitted by the \r\ncontract manufacturer or any responsible person whose products are manufactured or processed \r\nat such facility (section 607(a)(3) of the FD&C Act). Also, note that the renewal period and \r\ntimeframe to submit updates for a cosmetics product facility registration may be different than \r\nfor other FDA-regulated products for which the facility may also be required to register.",

Initial Listing \r\nThe responsible person of a cosmetic product that is marketed on December 29, 2022, \r\nmust submit a cosmetic product listing, or ensure such submission is made, not later than \r\nDecember 29, 2023, or for a cosmetic product that is first marketed after December 29, \r\n2022, within 120 days of marketing such product in interstate commerce (section \r\n607(c)(2) of the FD&C Act). Consistent with the approach for registration of a facility \r\nthat starts manufacturing or processing cosmetic products after December 29, 2022 \r\n(section 607(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act), FDA expects the product listing for a cosmetic \r\nproduct first marketed after December 29, 2022, to be submitted within 120 days of \r\nmarketing the product, or within 120 days of December 29, 2023 (which is April 27, \r\n2024), whichever is later. Note: On November 8, 2023, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Compliance \r\nPolicy for Cosmetic Product Facility Registration and Cosmetic Product Listing. ” This \r\nguidance explains that FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section \r\n607 of the FD&C Act related to cosmetic product listing until July 1, 2024. b. Update to Content and Renewal \r\n \r\nThe responsible person must provide any updates to such listing annually (section \r\n607(c)(5) of the FD&C Act). This includes an update that the product was discontinued. FDA is providing for an abbreviated process for the renewal of any cosmetic product \r\nlisting, as required under section 607(c)(3), for which there has been no change since the \r\nresponsible person submitted the previous listing. G. What if my product is both a drug and a cosmetic product? Do have I \r\nhave to comply with cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic \r\nproduct listing requirements under section 607 of the FD&C Act? A cosmetic product that is also a drug is not subject to the listing requirements under section 607 \r\nof the FD&C Act. Likewise, a facility that manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are \r\nalso drugs is not subject to the registration requirement under section 607 unless it also \r\nmanufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not also drugs (see section 613 of the \r\nFD&C Act). Cosmetic product facility registration and product listing are available using the \r\nsame electronic submission process available to register an establishment and list a drug with \r\nFDA. This will help to streamline the process of submitting registration and listing information \r\nfor cosmetics facilities and products for entities that also submit drug establishment and listing \r\ninformation.",

Do owners and operators of facilities that only manufacture or process cosmetic \r\ningredients need to register their facilities? Does a responsible person need to submit a \r\nproduct listing for cosmetic ingredients? A. No, at this time, FDA only expects non-exempt facilities to register if they manufacture or \r\nprocess the final formulation of cosmetic ingredients (including a final formulation that \r\nincludes a single ingredient). This includes final formulations that have not yet been \r\npackaged. FDA only expects non-exempt responsible persons to list cosmetic products that \r\nare marketed for users (e.g., consumers or professional use). Q2. Can a consultant be a “responsible person” under section 607 of the FD&C Act? A. A consultant can only be a responsible person if they meet the definition of “responsible \r\nperson” in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act. A “responsible person” as defined in section \r\n604(4) of the FD&C Act, means the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic \r\nproduct whose name appears on the label of such cosmetic product in accordance with \r\nsection 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Q3. Can a company located outside of the U.S. be the “responsible person”? A. “Responsible person,” as defined in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act, means the \r\nmanufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic product whose name appears on the label \r\nof such cosmetic product in accordance with section 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a) \r\nof the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. A company located outside of the U.S. could be a \r\n“responsible person” so long as they are the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the \r\ncosmetic product. However, we note that, under section 609(a) of the FD&C Act, each \r\ncosmetic product shall bear a label that includes a domestic address, domestic phone number, \r\nor electronic contact information, which may be a website, through which the responsible \r\nperson can receive adverse event reports with respect to such cosmetic product. We \r\nrecommend that firms consider when selecting electronic contact information, such as an \r\nemail address or a website (whether foreign or domestic), how they can best respond to these \r\nreports and meet maintenance, inspection, and reporting requirements under section 605 of \r\nthe FD&C Act. Q4. Is the brand name the same as the product name? A. No. FDA does not consider the brand name and product name to be the same. 11 This section of the guidance, Appendix B (designated with a shaded background), is being distributed for \r\ncomment purposes only.",

The statement of identity provides information about the type or kind of cosmetic \r\nproduct in the package to help the consumer understand the functional use of the product. The brand name is the distinguishing name used by a company to identify a commercial product \r\non the product label. The brand name may be proprietary and/or registered as a trademark. Q5. What are examples of products whose manufacture does not qualify the responsible \r\nperson or facility for the small business exemptions under section 612 of the FD&C \r\nAct? A. Section 612 of the FD&C Act provides exemptions to certain small businesses from the \r\nrequirements of sections 606 (Good Manufacturing Practice) and 607 (Registration and \r\nProduct Listing). However, such exemptions from the requirements of sections 606 and 607 \r\nof the FD&C Act do not apply to any responsible person or facility engaged in the \r\nmanufacturing or processing of any of the following products listed in section 612(b) of the \r\nFD&C Act: \r\n \r\n(1) Cosmetic products that regularly come into contact with mucus membrane of the eye under \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual. (2) Cosmetic products that are injected. (3) Cosmetic products that are intended for internal use. (4) Cosmetic products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours under \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer is not part of such \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual. Q6. What are examples of products that regularly come into contact with the mucus \r\nmembrane of the eye? A. While there may be certain exceptions, an eye makeup remover, a liquid or mucosal eyeliner, \r\nor a false eyelash adhesive may regularly come into contact with the mucous membrane of \r\nthe eye under conditions of use that are customary or usual, such that they would not qualify \r\nthe small business exemption (see section 612(b)(1) of the FD&C Act). However, facial \r\ncleaners, moisturizers, and serums generally would not be expected to regularly come into \r\ncontact with the mucous membrane of the eye under conditions of use that are customary or \r\nusual. Q7. What are examples of products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 \r\nhours? A. Examples of cosmetic products that are intended to alter the appearance for more than 24 \r\nhours and removal by the consumer is not part of such conditions of use that are customary \r\nor usual, as described in section 612(b)(4) of the FD&C Act, may include certain nail \r\npolishes, some hair products, some eyebrow dyes, and certain leave-on skin preparations.

Q8. If a facility engages in the manufacturing or processing of cosmetic products listed in \r\nsection 612(b) of the FD&C Act, does the facility need to include information required \r\nunder section 607(b)(2)(D) and (E) for only the cosmetic products listed in section 612(b), \r\nor for all of the cosmetic products manufactured or processed by the facility? A. The exemptions in section 612 of the FD&C Act apply to responsible persons and owners \r\nand operators of facilities that meet the definition of a small business in section 612(a). Thus, a facility is required to include information required under section 607(b)(2)(D) and \r\n(E) for all of the cosmetic products manufactured or processed by the facility if a facility \r\nmanufactures or processes any of the following cosmetic products:  \r\n \r\n(1) Cosmetic products that regularly come into contact with mucus membrane of the eye under \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual. (2) Cosmetic products that are injected. (3) Cosmetic products that are intended for internal use. (4) Cosmetic products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours under \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer is not part of such \r\nconditions of use that are customary or usual. Q9. Where can I submit documentation that my business meets the small business \r\nexemption in order to receive an exemption certificate from FDA? A. FDA is not generally asking companies to submit this information nor does FDA provide \r\nsmall business exemption certificates for cosmetic product facilities or responsible persons. Q10. Does an importer need to register and/or list under 607 of the FD&C Act? A. If an importer meets the definition of a facility and/or a responsible person in section 604 of \r\nthe FD&C Act, and does not meet any exemption, then they must comply with any \r\napplicable registration or listing requirements. Otherwise, the importer is not required to \r\nregister or list. Q11. Does a laboratory that only performs testing on cosmetic products used for research \r\nand development need to register? A. No. If a laboratory tests cosmetic products that are solely for use in research, development, or \r\nevaluation, and that are not offered for retail sale, it does not need to register because it is an",

Q12. Does a laboratory that performs cosmetic product batch release testing need to \r\nregister? A. Yes. Cosmetic product batch release testing is part of manufacturing and processing. Laboratories conducting this testing are considered facilities subject to the registration \r\nrequirements. Q13. My company owns 2 buildings with 2 addresses, and 1 of the buildings is for storage \r\nonly. Do we need to register the building used only for storage? A. No. An establishment that solely performs storage (holding) with respect to cosmetic \r\nproducts is not required to register under section 607 of the FD&C Act. Q14. If a contract manufacturer of cosmetic products is located outside of the United States \r\nare they required to be registered with the FDA under section 607 of the FD&C Act? Is \r\nthere an exemption from registration if the contract manufacturer follows ISO22716? A. If a contract manufacturer manufactures or processes cosmetic product(s) distributed in the \r\nUnited States, then the contract manufacturing facility must be registered with the FDA, even \r\nif the contract manufacturer is located outside of the United States. More information, \r\nincluding on exemptions, are described in section III above. There is not an exemption from \r\nregistration for following ISO22716. Q15. Do hair coloring preparations (including hair dyes) need to be listed? A. Yes. Hair coloring preparations, including hair dyes, are cosmetic products and therefore \r\nneed to be listed, unless an exemption applies. Q16. Do hairbrushes and wigs need to be listed? A. No. We do not expect hairbrushes and wigs to be listed. Q17. My cosmetic products don’t fit into any of the product categories provided in \r\nAppendix A. Therefore, what product category and code should be used? A. We recommend that you select the product category and code in Appendix A (above) that \r\nmatch most closely and use the “other” category and code if another category and code does \r\nnot appear to fit. Keep in mind that products intended for use in the eye area should be \r\nentered into an eye area product category. FDA intends to periodically update the product categories and codes.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA \r\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the \r\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office \r\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION  \r\n \r\nThis guidance is intended to assist owners or operators of cosmetic product facilities that are \r\nsubject to the requirements related to facility registration and responsible persons that are subject \r\nto the requirements related to cosmetic product listing under the Federal Food, Drug, and \r\nCosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This guidance document discusses FDA’s compliance policy for \r\nthese requirements. FDA intends to delay enforcement of these requirements for six months to \r\nhelp ensure that industry has sufficient time to submit facility registration and product listing \r\ninformation. This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the Agency has \r\ndetermined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate. 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2). This guidance is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in \r\naccordance with the Agency’s good guidance practices. 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5). FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should \r\nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are \r\ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND \r\n \r\nOn December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Pub. L. 117-328) into law, which included the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 \r\n(MoCRA). Among other provisions, MoCRA added section 607 to the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364c), establishing requirements for cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product \r\nlisting. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) in cooperation with the Office of \r\nCosmetics and Colors (OCAC)/Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the Food and Drug \r\nAdministration.",

          "text": "3 \r\n \r\nSection 607(a) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility2 that \r\n“engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United \r\nStates” to register each facility with FDA. Section 607(a)(1)(A) provides that owners or \r\noperators of facilities engaged in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product on \r\nDecember 29, 2022, must register each facility no later than December 29, 2023. Owners or \r\noperators of facilities that first engage in manufacturing or processing a cosmetic product after \r\nDecember 29, 2022, must register such facilities within 60 days of first engaging in such activity \r\nor by February 27, 2024, whichever is later (Section 607(a)(1)(B)). Section 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible person3 \r\nmust submit to FDA “a cosmetic product listing” or ensure that such submission is \r\nmade. Section 607(c)(2) of the FD&C Act provides that the responsible person for a cosmetic \r\nproduct that was marketed on December 29, 2022, must submit a cosmetic product listing, no \r\nlater than December 29, 2023, or for a cosmetic product that is first marketed after December 29, \r\n2022, within 120 days of distributing such product in interstate commerce. Certain small businesses, as defined in section 612 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364h), are not \r\nrequired to register facilities and list cosmetic product(s). In addition, a facility is not required to \r\nregister if it is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and \r\ndevices) unless the facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not subject \r\nto the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act (see section 613 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364i)). A cosmetic product does not need to be listed if it is also subject to the requirements in \r\nchapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and devices). FDA issued a draft guidance entitled “Registration and Listing of Cosmetic Product Facilities \r\nand Products” on August 8, 2023 (88 FR 53490). The draft guidance, when finalized, will \r\nprovide recommendations and instructions to assist persons submitting cosmetic product facility \r\nregistrations and product listings to FDA. FDA is also developing an electronic submission portal, Cosmetics Direct, to streamline \r\nsubmission and receipt of facility registration and product listing information under section 607 \r\nof the FD&C Act, and is developing paper forms (FDA Form 5066 and 5067) as an alternative \r\nsubmission tool. FDA will conduct a pilot program to ensure that the new electronic submission \r\nportal is functional and usable so that industry will be able to meet its statutory obligations. As \r\nanother alternative, users may transmit SPL-formatted submissions through FDA’s Electronic \r\nSubmissions Gateway (ESG),4 or any SPL authoring software including Xforms.5 FDA strongly \r\nencourages electronic submissions to facilitate efficiency and timeliness of data submission and \r\nmanagement for the agency. FDA anticipates that electronic submission, technical assistance \r\ndocuments, and paper submission forms will be available in early December 2023. 2 The term “facility” is defined in section 604(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364(3)). 3 The term “responsible person” is defined in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364(4)). 4 For more information on FDA’s Electronic Submissions Gateway, please refer to the webpage at \r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/industry/electronic-submissions-gateway. 5 For more information on Xforms, please refer to the webpage at https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-\r\nlabeling-resources/spl-xforms. In addition, the technical details on using SPL for cosmetic product facility \r\nregistration and product listing will be available in the FDA’s SPL Implementation Guide with Validation \r\nProcedures available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84201/download.",

However, FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section 607 of the FD&C Act \r\nrelated to cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product listing for an additional six \r\nmonths after the December 29, 2023, statutory deadline, or until July 1, 2024, to provide \r\nregulated industry additional time to comply with these requirements. In addition, FDA does not \r\nintend to enforce the registration requirement for owners or operators of facilities that first \r\nengaged in manufacturing or processing a cosmetic product after December 29, 2022, or the \r\nlisting requirement for cosmetic products first marketed after December 29, 2022, until July 1, \r\n2024.

Industry has expressed concerns that they need additional time, for \r\nexample to gather the relevant information required for facility registration and product listing, \r\nincluding obtaining facility registration numbers to associate with cosmetic product listings, \r\nobtain access to the electronic submissions database, and enter and submit accurate registration \r\nand listing information.",

Introduction \r\n78 In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, FDA adapted its operations for field \r\n79 activities to provide oversight of regulated industry while mitigating the spread of COVID-19. One set of \r\n80 tools used during the COVID-19 public health emergency for oversight of FDA-regulated products was \r\n81 remote regulatory assessments (RRAs). The term “RRA” (as defined in the Question and Answers \r\n82 section) is used to describe a category of activities for which FDA may use different terminologies, but \r\n83 that are all considered to be types of RRAs, including “remote interactive evaluations”2 and “remote \r\n84 record reviews. ” Such activities, along with others identified in this draft guidance, are considered RRAs \r\n85 for purposes of this guidance. In the presence of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA \r\n86 utilized RRAs to assess establishments and their compliance with applicable FDA requirements. Based on \r\n1 This draft guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Affairs in cooperation with the Center for \r\nBiologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Food Safety and \r\nApplied Nutrition, the Center for Tobacco Products, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for \r\nVeterinary Medicine, the Office of Food Policy and Response, and the Office of Combination Products. 2 See Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities, Draft Guidance \r\nfor Industry, issued October 2023.

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft — Not for Implementation \r\n87 this experience,3 FDA has noted the value of RRAs and concluded that they should be used for certain \r\n88 scenarios outside the COVID-19 pandemic and for all types of FDA-regulated products.4 FDA has \r\n89 developed this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions related to RRAs. When \r\n90 finalized, this guidance is intended to help enhance industry’s understanding of RRAs, thereby facilitating \r\n91 FDA’s process for conducting RRAs. 92 Throughout this guidance, the terms, “FDA,” “the Agency,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Food and \r\n93 Drug Administration. In this guidance, the term “establishment” includes any facility, entity, person, \r\n94 importer, or site, whether foreign or domestic, subject to the laws administered by FDA. 95 FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\n96 responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \r\n97 viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use \r\n98 of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not \r\n99 required. 100 II. Background \r\n101 FDA uses a variety of tools5 for oversight of FDA-regulated products and establishments. During the \r\n102 COVID-19 pandemic, FDA used RRAs to help the Agency conduct oversight, mitigate risk, and meet \r\n103 critical public health needs with respect to certain FDA-regulated products. RRAs have included: (1) \r\n104 mandatory RRAs involving review of records or other information submitted by certain establishments \r\n105 upon request from FDA under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act and review of records from food \r\n106 establishments subject to FD&C Act section 8056 (the latter hereinafter referred to as “requests for \r\n107 Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C)”); \r\n108 and (2) voluntary RRAs involving remote requests for records and/or interactive evaluations (such as \r\n109 remote livestreaming video of operations, teleconferences, and screen sharing). 110 FDA’s experiences have identified significant benefits in using RRAs. For instance, RRAs have assisted \r\n111 FDA in verifying corrective actions taken in response to inspections of previously compliant \r\n3 See, e.g., FDA’s November 2021 “An Update to the Resiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight,” where \r\nwe reported on the use of RRAs as a tool to fortify FDA oversight efforts throughout the pandemic. 4 See, e.g., question A.2. describing to whom voluntary and mandatory RRAs may apply. 5 See, e.g., the discussion of alternative tools used for oversight listed in FDA’s May 2021 “Resiliency Roadmap for \r\nFDA Inspectional Oversight,” and Section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 \r\nU.S.C. 374). 6 Section 805 of the FD&C Act requires importers as defined for purposes of section 805 of the FD&C Act to \r\nperform certain risk-based Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) activities. Further, section 805(d) of the \r\nFD&C Act provides for FSVP records to be made available promptly to the FDA upon request. The FSVP \r\nregulation states that, if requested in writing by FDA, records must be sent to FDA electronically, or through any \r\nother means that delivers the records promptly, rather than making them available for review at an importer’s place \r\nof business. 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3), 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C). 4",

RRAs have also \r\n113 provided information about deficient practices, leading FDA to take regulatory actions and/or conduct \r\n114 inspections, as well as informing future inspection planning. RRAs were used to help support review and \r\n115 promote timely approval or authorization of marketing submissions for FDA-regulated products. In the \r\n116 food program, RRAs have assisted in determining compliance with veterinary feed directive regulations, \r\n117 assessing foreign manufacturing process records, adding foreign establishments to import alerts, and \r\n118 issuance of warning letters. 119 Based on these experiences, FDA has determined that RRAs are valuable and, therefore, under certain \r\n120 circumstances, should be continued to assist FDA in its mission to protect public health, oversee regulated \r\n121 industry, and ensure all types of regulated products comply with FDA requirements. 122 With respect to section 704(a)(4), this provision of the FD&C Act, including as recently amended by the \r\n123 Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA),8 gives FDA authority to request (and requires \r\n124 establishments to provide) any records or other information that FDA may inspect under section 704 of \r\n125 the FD&C Act, in advance of or in lieu of inspections of such establishments that engage in the \r\n126 manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or device,9 or a site or \r\n127 facility that is subject to inspection under section 704(a)(5)(C) (i.e., sites, entities, or facilities subject to \r\n128 bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) inspections). 129 The Agency believes that FDA’s use of both mandatory and voluntary RRAs, as applicable, for all types \r\n130 of FDA-regulated products is in the interest of the public health, and the Agency is issuing this guidance \r\n131 to provide further transparency to stakeholders about the circumstances in which mandatory and \r\n132 voluntary RRAs may be used. 133 The Agency is also issuing this guidance to promote greater consistency in the way RRAs are conducted, \r\n134 including explaining processes for responding to an RRA request, and outlining factors we use for \r\n135 evaluating whether an establishment has responded timely and appropriately to a mandatory request. 7 In instances where FDA has identified objectionable conditions regarding compliance with laws and regulations \r\nenforced by FDA (e.g., Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements for FDA-regulated products), FDA may \r\nsubsequently determine compliance based on a voluntary commitment of corrective actions, or, when warranted, \r\nFDA may pursue a regulatory action. If FDA pursues a regulatory action after conducting an RRA, we generally \r\nwill conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented; however, for certain regulatory \r\nactions and with respect to select instances involving certain programs, FDA could determine that an RRA is \r\nappropriate. 8 FDORA was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (2022). FDORA \r\nsections 3611(b)(1)(A) and 3612(a) added device and bioresearch monitoring establishments as establishments that \r\nare subject to mandatory requests for records or other information under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 \r\nU.S.C. 374(a)(4)). 9 The terms “drug” and “device” are defined at FD&C Act sections 201(g)(1) and (h), respectively.

Questions and Answers \r\n137 This section is intended to provide FDA’s current thinking regarding the requesting, conducting, and use \r\n138 of RRAs by FDA. 139 A. Remote Regulatory Assessment Fundamentals \r\n140 1. What is an RRA? 141 An RRA is an examination of an FDA-regulated establishment and/or its records, conducted entirely \r\n142 remotely, to evaluate compliance with applicable FDA requirements. RRAs assist in protecting human \r\n143 and animal health, informing regulatory decisions, and verifying certain information submitted to the \r\n144 Agency. 145 RRAs are a tool FDA may use to support regulatory decisions and oversight activities. Mandatory RRAs \r\n146 are conducted under legal authorities mandating the establishment’s participation. Requests for records or \r\n147 other information from establishments subject to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, and requests for \r\n148 FSVP records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), are included among RRAS that are \r\n149 mandatory. RRAs that are not conducted under statutory or regulatory authorities mandating an \r\n150 establishment’s participation are voluntary in that an establishment can decline to participate or withdraw \r\n151 participation during the RRA, in which case the Agency may consider other tools for evaluating \r\n152 compliance with FDA requirements. 153 RRAs complement FDA’s authority to conduct inspections under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and \r\n154 other applicable FDA authorities. RRAs do not limit the authority of FDA to conduct inspections under \r\n155 section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and other applicable FDA authorities. 156 2. Who may be subject to an RRA? 157 • Mandatory RRAs \r\n158 Mandatory RRAs include those conducted for: (1) establishments that are subject to section 704(a)(4) of \r\n159 the FD&C Act10; and (2) importers, as defined in 21 CFR 1.500, that are subject to FSVP under section \r\n160 805(d) of the FD&C Act and implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), as \r\n161 applicable.11 \r\n10 As described above, section 704(a)(4)’s mandatory records request authority applies to drug and device \r\nestablishments and to sites, entities, or facilities subject to BIMO inspections. See footnote 8 for information on \r\nrecent amendments that made device establishments and BIMO sites, entities, and facilities subject to mandatory \r\nrecords request authority under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. 11 As discussed above, RRAs have included these mandatory remote requests for records or other information. Although they are discussed in this draft guidance in response to certain frequently asked questions, RRAs \r\nconducted under section 704(a)(4) or under FSVP are not necessarily the only types of mandatory RRAs for which \r\nFDA has authority. 6",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft — Not for Implementation \r\n162 Upon initiating a mandatory RRA, FDA intends to make clear the authorities under which the RRA is \r\n163 being requested. 164 • Voluntary RRAs \r\n165 If an RRA is not mandated by statute or regulation (or FDA opts against exercising its mandatory RRA \r\n166 authority in a certain instance), FDA may request that any establishment (e.g., food producers, tobacco \r\n167 product manufacturers, drug or medical device manufacturers12,13, clinical investigators, or others) \r\n168 participate in a voluntary RRA. 169 3. Are RRAs replacing other established means of obtaining information outside of \r\n170 inspections? 171 No, RRAs are not intended to limit or replace other established means of obtaining information necessary \r\n172 for FDA to accomplish its public health mission outside of inspections, including, among other things, \r\n173 applicant information request letters, registration confirmations, meetings, product submission, \r\n174 application assessments, or follow-up communications during outbreaks or other emergencies. Similarly, \r\n175 if, for example, FDA calls an applicant to inform them that a submission or application is missing certain \r\n176 information, this is not an RRA. Although these activities may be conducted remotely, the Agency does \r\n177 not consider these RRAs.14 \r\n178 4. Is an RRA an inspection? 179 An RRA is not an inspection under sections 704(a)(1) or 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act. Generally, an \r\n180 inspection, such as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, involves duly designated officers or \r\n181 employees of the FDA physically entering (at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner), \r\n182 establishments subject to regulation under the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable \r\n183 requirements.15 \r\n184 However, because remote requests for FSVP records are under the authority of section 805(d) of the \r\n185 FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulation, these record requests function as inspections in that FDA \r\n186 uses these records requests to evaluate a food importer’s compliance with FSVP. 12 In this draft guidance, references to drug and device manufacturers means establishments that engage in the \r\nmanufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or device, respectively. See, e.g., \r\nsection 510 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 207.1 and 807.3. 13 By virtue of applying to both drug and device establishments, section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act also applies to \r\nestablishments that manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process combination products (see section \r\n503(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act) and the drug and device constituent part(s) (defined under 21 CFR Part 4) of such \r\ncombination products. Establishments that engage in the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or \r\nprocessing of combination products that are not subject to the authorities under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act \r\nmay voluntarily participate in an RRA. 14 FDA intends to clearly indicate when we consider an activity to be an RRA so establishments can differentiate \r\nRRA interactions from non-RRA interactions. 15 FD&C Act, section 704(a)(1). Relatedly, for requests for records and other information under section 704(a)(4), \r\nFDA does not intend to issue a Form FDA 482, Notice of Inspection or Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations \r\nduring the RRA process. 7",

When may FDA initiate or request to conduct an RRA? 188 FDA may initiate or, in the case of a voluntary RRA, request to conduct, an RRA whenever we determine \r\n189 an RRA is appropriate to help fulfill the Agency’s regulatory responsibilities and protect human and \r\nanimal health. For example: \r\n191 • When FDA cannot conduct an inspection due to travel limitations brought on by public health \r\n192 emergencies, natural disasters, or other situations making travel infeasible. 193 • When FDA determines that an RRA will assist us in conducting elements of establishment \r\n194 oversight or support regulatory decisions. Examples include preparing for an already planned \r\ninspection, following up on a consumer complaint, assisting in verifying that an \r\n196 establishment has completed certain corrective actions (e.g., in response to a previous \r\n197 inspection, or previous RRA), or supporting the review of a marketing submission. 198 FDA intends to use a risk-based approach to determine whether to initiate or request an RRA. Factors that \r\n199 may be considered include, but are not limited to, establishment location, inspection history, complexity \r\nof product and process, and travel restrictions. Programs and centers within FDA may assess risk \r\n201 differently based on those factors. 202 The above examples are illustrative, and the ultimate decision to initiate or request an RRA rests with \r\n203 FDA, as we retain discretion to deploy RRAs as appropriate. FDA does not accept requests to perform an \r\n204 RRA. When FDA determines an inspection (as opposed to an RRA) is necessary, FDA intends to perform \r\nan inspection. 206 6. Will FDA use RRAs during or as part of an FDA inspection of an establishment? 207 No, FDA does not plan to conduct RRAs and inspections16 of an establishment under sections 704(a)(1) \r\n208 or 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act simultaneously. An RRA is conducted remotely by FDA staff without \r\n209 FDA staff present at an establishment conducting an inspection. However, an RRA could precede, \r\nprompt, or be a follow-up to, an inspection. When an RRA precedes an inspection, FDA will generally \r\n211 conclude the RRA prior to initiating the inspection. FDA may combine any information gained from the \r\n212 RRA with any resulting observations from the subsequent inspection. In such circumstance, FDA would \r\n213 confirm any observations from the RRA during the subsequent inspection before including them on any \r\n214 Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations issued at the conclusion of the subsequent inspection. Additionally, FDA may conduct an RRA following an inspection in order to conduct follow-up activities \r\n216 with the establishment or to assist in verifying corrective actions, if appropriate. 217 FDA may decide to conduct an RRA (e.g., livestreaming) during oversight activities independently \r\n218 conducted by state or foreign regulatory partners.17 \r\n16 FDA considers inspections that are done with state officers or employees duly commissioned under 702(a)(1)(A) \r\nof the FD&C Act to be FDA inspections for the purposes of this draft guidance. 17 Generally, FDA does not intend to conduct RRAs during Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) audits. 8",

What are the benefits of an RRA? 220 FDA, industry, and the general public can all benefit from RRAs as RRAs help the Agency to meet \r\n221 critical public health needs. These potential benefits may include, but are not limited to: \r\n222 • Allowing FDA to remotely evaluate compliance of FDA-regulated products, clinical studies, \r\n223 and establishments, as appropriate. This may identify issues that lead establishments to \r\n224 promptly make corrective actions, which may enhance the establishment’s preparedness for \r\n225 their next FDA inspection. 226 • Having an RRA precede an inspection under section 704(a) of the FD&C Act could reduce \r\n227 resource expenditure. For example, FDA may not need to review as many records during the \r\n228 inspection, reducing the time FDA is present at the establishment. 229 • Helping to support timely regulatory decisions (including the approval of an application or \r\n230 authorization for emergency use), without an inspection, when appropriate conditions are \r\n231 fulfilled, such as the ability to verify information in the marketing submission. In such cases, \r\n232 the application approval, or the authorization, must still meet applicable standards. 233 • Providing FDA additional information to incorporate into a risk-based inspection schedule, \r\n234 thereby helping FDA use inspectional resources more efficiently and effectively. 235 • Assisting FDA in verifying corrective actions.18 \r\n236 B. Remote Regulatory Assessment Expectations \r\n237 8. How may FDA request an RRA? 238 FDA may use multiple processes for requesting voluntary or initiating mandatory RRAs.19 \r\n239 • In general, for Voluntary RRAs \r\n240 o FDA expects to contact an establishment through the establishment’s point of \r\n241 contact,20 by email or phone, once we determine an RRA is appropriate based on \r\n242 FDA mission needs. 18 See footnotes 2 and 7. 19 When finalized, this draft guidance will represent the Agency’s current thinking on how RRAs apply generally to \r\nall FDA-regulated products. Other Agency documents may exist that provide additional information about RRAs \r\nwith respect to specific circumstances. See, e.g., FDA Staff Manual Guide 9004.1, Policy and Procedures for \r\nRequesting Records in Advance of or in Lieu of a Drug Inspection; FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual \r\n7303.878, FSVP Inspections; Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring \r\nFacilities, Draft Guidance for Industry, October 2023. 20 FDA will typically request to speak with an establishment’s owner, operator, or agent in charge at the site (i.e., top \r\nmanagement official at the site), or their designee. 9",

What might an establishment expect to happen during an RRA? 280 RRAs may entail, but are not limited to, any combination of the following, depending on the type of RRA \r\n281 involved: \r\n282 • FDA requests and reviews records and other information (such as electronic systems, and \r\n283 source records from non-clinical and clinical studies). 284 • Virtual meetings between FDA and responsible establishment personnel to review, where \r\n285 appropriate, the information provided to FDA, the establishment’s electronic systems, the \r\n286 establishment’s operations, and/or the establishment’s standard operating procedures. 287 Interactions beyond the virtual meeting between FDA and an establishment may continue \r\n288 during the course of an RRA. 289 • Use of livestream and/or pre-recorded video, where appropriate, to examine facilities, \r\n290 operations, data, and other information. 291 FDA may review electronic systems and source records by screen sharing and livestream/video.26 FDA \r\n292 may provide updates to the establishment on observations and outstanding issues, whenever feasible, \r\n293 throughout the RRA. FDA expects to make reasonable and appropriate efforts to discuss observations \r\n294 with the management of the establishment, to minimize surprises, errors, and misunderstandings. 295 While mandatory RRAs that are conducted under their respective relevant authorities involve activities \r\n296 detailed by such authorities, an establishment could agree to participate in activities beyond what is \r\n297 required. For instance, FDA may request that an establishment subject to a section 704(a)(4) records \r\n298 request instead voluntarily participate in an RRA that accommodates review through interactive \r\n299 technologies such as video streaming. 24 See section 704(a)(4)(B). 25 See footnote 15. 26 FDA does not intend to record RRAs conducted via livestream, video, or screen sharing; however, FDA may \r\nrequest records we review during those sessions. 11",

Are there any consequences for declining to participate in an RRA? 301 • Voluntary RRAs \r\n302 Because of the voluntary nature of these assessments, declining to participate in a voluntary RRA will not \r\n303 result in any enforcement action by the Agency based on the declination.27 FDA may consider other \r\n304 activities necessary to exercise our oversight responsibilities regarding that establishment, such as an \r\ninspection, based on considerations such as when the establishment was last inspected, our assessment of \r\n306 risks, and other relevant factors. An establishment may decline to participate in a voluntary RRA, but an \r\n307 establishment may not opt out of an FDA inspection. 308 Moreover, if an establishment declines FDA’s request to conduct a voluntary RRA, FDA may not be able \r\n309 to assess the establishment’s activities until we exercise other oversight tools. Indeed, a voluntary RRA \r\nmay be the most expedient means for FDA to assess the establishment, especially when factors prevent \r\n311 FDA from conducting a timely inspection. For example, in circumstances which temporarily limit FDA’s \r\n312 ability to conduct an inspection, such as travel restrictions, it may take FDA longer to assess an \r\n313 establishment or, for example, a marketing submission in which an establishment is referenced, absent an \r\n314 RRA because we lack necessary information. • Mandatory RRAs \r\n316 FDA may deem the following actions, among others, as declining to participate in a mandatory RRA: \r\n317 failing to respond, withdrawing participation, and refusing to provide records upon a lawful request. 318 There are consequences for declining mandatory RRAs. For example, an establishment that refuses a \r\n319 request for records or other information under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act may be in violation of \r\nthe FD&C Act.28 \r\n321 Similarly, if an importer refuses FDA’s written request for FSVP records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or \r\n322 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), the importer may be in violation of section 805 of the FD&C Act, and the food offered \r\n323 for import by the importer may be subject to refusal under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act.29 \r\n324 FDA intends to take appropriate action against persons30 and products that are in violation of the FD&C \r\nAct. 326 11. Are there any technological expectations for an RRA? 327 The technological expectations will vary depending on the type of RRA and its scope. Certain RRAs \r\n328 involve records requests, and the records may be submitted electronically or through other means. Other \r\n329 RRAs may require additional technological capability. For example, if FDA expects that the RRA could \r\ninclude the use of live streaming video, FDA may inquire about hardware or internet connectivity to \r\n331 assess IT operability, security, and privacy controls to protect the confidentiality of the data. The quality \r\n27 This would not be considered a refusal for purposes of section 301(e) or (f), or 807, of the FD&C Act. 28 See e.g., section 301(e) of the FD&C Act (Prohibited Acts). 29 21 CFR 1.514(a). 30 See section 201(e) of the FD&C Act (Definitions). 12",

Requests for Records or Other Information as Part of Remote Regulatory Assessments \r\n12. What records or other information may FDA request as part of an RRA? 346 For voluntary RRAs, FDA may request records or other information appropriate to determine whether an \r\n347 establishment or FDA-regulated product or clinical study is in compliance with applicable requirements. 348 The records and other information will typically be similar to what FDA would request during an \r\n349 inspection under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act. In the case of mandatory RRAs, the records or other information we request, and the circumstances under \r\n351 which we request them, will conform to the relevant legal authority. For example, under section \r\n352 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, FDA may request any records or other information subject to inspection \r\n353 under section 704. For mandatory RRAs under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), FDA may \r\n354 request any and all records that are required to be maintained under 21 CFR 1, Subpart L. Examples of records or other information the Agency may request during a voluntary or mandatory RRA \r\n356 include, but are not limited to: \r\n357 • Records of specific production lots or batches as well as product-specific information, such as \r\n358 periodic product reviews,31 product quality reports, equipment records, process validation \r\n359 records and reports, test results, records of product postmarket defects or other information \r\nrelated to compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements. 361 • Certain summaries or lists of records, such as a summary of batches manufactured and their \r\n362 disposition, or a summary of discrepancies and investigations related to manufacturing and \r\n363 testing. 31 See 21 CFR 211.180(e). 13",

If the RRA requests records or other information, what is the timeframe for submitting \r\n392 the records and other information to FDA? 393 For mandatory RRAs, FDA will request that records and other information be submitted within a \r\n394 timeframe consistent with the relevant legal authority.35 For voluntary RRAs, FDA may suggest \r\n395 timeframes to ensure the RRA is completed in a reasonable amount of time and expects establishments to \r\n396 work diligently to provide the requested records and other information. 397 The circumstances that relate to FDA’s expectations for reasonable request timeframes may include: \r\n398 • The size, available resources, and capabilities of the establishment, including those that might \r\n399 exist for small businesses. 400 • The type, complexity, and volume of the records and other information being requested. 401 • The reason for the request, such as an application action goal date, deadline, or other time-\r\n402 sensitive reasons. 403 • Need for translation of records. 404 15. How should records or other information in response to an RRA request be provided to \r\n405 FDA? 406 Except as provided below, requested records or other information generally should be submitted in an \r\n407 electronic format. FDA intends to provide a secure means to send requested records and information. For \r\n408 electronic documents, establishments should identify any limitations on external access and ensure that \r\n409 encrypted and password-protected files can be accessed by FDA. FDA will follow applicable federal law \r\n410 governing the confidentiality of records and information submitted to the Agency (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 411 552(b)(4), 18 U.S.C. 1905, 21 C.F.R. Part 20). 412 FDA recognizes that some establishments maintain documents in paper format. Requested documents \r\n413 maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files, when \r\n414 possible, and sent by the secure means identified by FDA. If a paper format is the only option for sending \r\n415 copies of records, FDA will provide the name and contact information of the FDA staff member to whom \r\n416 the records should be sent. 35 For example, for RRAs under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, persons subject to the request must provide the \r\nrequested records or other information within a reasonable timeframe, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable \r\nmanner. See Section 704(a)(4)(A). See also FDA’s Staff Manual Guide, 9004.1, Policy and Procedures for \r\nRequesting Records in Advance of or in lieu of a Drug Inspection for more information on timeframes. For RRAs \r\nunder section 805(d) of the FD&C Act, persons subject to the request must provide the records promptly. FDA \r\ngenerally expects FSVP records to be sent within 72 hours of the request. See FDA’s Guidance for Industry: Foreign \r\nSupplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals, available here: \r\nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-foreign-supplier-\r\nverification-programs-importers-food-humans-and-animals. 15",

Copies of the \r\noriginal records and information should also be included in the response, where appropriate. For certain \r\n421 RRAs, if a verified translation is not immediately available, FDA may request that the initial translation \r\n422 be followed up with a verified translation as soon as practicable. 423 If the records or other information are provided as part of a section 704(a)(4) request, the records and \r\n424 information may be submitted in either electronic or physical form. FDA will provide confirmation upon \r\nreceipt of the records. 37 In general, FDA intends to maintain open communications to discuss any records \r\n426 received over the course of the RRA. 427 For RRAs under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), records must be sent electronically, or \r\n428 through any other means that delivers the records promptly upon written request from FDA. 429 D. Completion of a Remote Regulatory Assessment \r\n16. What may occur upon completion of an RRA? 431 Upon completion of an RRA, FDA may have a closeout meeting38 with the establishment’s management. 432 At the closeout meeting, FDA may present a written list of RRA observations, if any, and describe and \r\n433 discuss such observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response. 434 For purposes of this guidance, RRA observations are defined as conditions and/or practices observed \r\nduring the RRA that indicate, in the judgment of the FDA employee(s) conducting the RRA, a potential \r\n436 violation of the laws enforced by FDA. FDA does not intend to issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional \r\n437 Observations, for an RRA.39 (See question 6 for a discussion of how observations from an RRA may be \r\n438 confirmed during an inspection and included on a Form 483). 439 An establishment should be aware that a written list of observations may be subject to a request under the \r\nFreedom of Information Act at the time the disclosure to the establishment is first made (see 21 CFR \r\n441 20.101(a)) and may be made publicly available, with applicable redaction of information that is exempt \r\n442 from public disclosure (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b), 18 U.S.C. 1905, 21 U.S.C. 331(j), 360j(c), 360nn(e), \r\n443 and 387f(c), and 21 C.F.R. Part 20). 444 FDA encourages establishments to respond during the meeting, and/or provide written responses to the \r\nobservations within fifteen (15) U.S. business days. Responses or corrective actions submitted to FDA \r\n446 during that timeframe in response to the issues identified during the RRA generally will be considered \r\n36 For RRAs of FSVP importers, upon FDA request, the importers must provide within a reasonable time an English \r\ntranslation of records maintained in a language other than English. See 21 CFR 1.510(b)(1), 1.512(b)(5)(C)(ii)(A). 37 Section 704(a)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act. 38 There may be some instances where a closeout meeting may not happen, such as for some requests under section \r\n704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. In such circumstances, FDA intends to notify the establishment that the RRA is \r\nconcluded, along with any pertinent information. 39 FDA will use a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations, to issue observations to an importer based on RRAs that are \r\nFSVP record reviews under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C). 16",

It does not establish any rights for any person and is \r\nnot binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the \r\nrequirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, \r\ncontact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. Introduction \r\n \r\nUnder section 601(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 361(c)), a cosmetic is deemed to be adulterated if it “has been prepared, packed, or held under \r\ninsanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may \r\nhave been rendered injurious to health. ”  Cosmetic products prepared, packed, or held under \r\ninsanitary conditions could become contaminated and cause serious adverse events. The risk of \r\nsuch adverse events is even greater in products such as tattoo inks, which are introduced through \r\nthe skin. Tattooing has become increasingly popular in the United States. Polling and data suggest that \r\nabout 30 percent of all Americans, and 40 percent of those aged 18-34, have at least one tattoo \r\n(Refs. 1 and 2). State and local jurisdictions generally regulate the practice of intradermal \r\ntattooing, including permanent makeup. FDA regulates, among other things, the inks used in \r\nthat practice.2  Tattoo inks are cosmetics as defined by section 201(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, \r\nand Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(i)) because they are articles intended to be \r\nintroduced into or otherwise applied to the human body for beautifying, promoting \r\nattractiveness, or altering the appearance. FDA is issuing this guidance to help tattoo ink manufacturers and distributors recognize \r\nsituations in which a tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms, and thus, be \r\npotentially injurious to health. This guidance also recommends certain steps that manufacturers \r\nand distributors could take to help prevent the occurrence of these conditions, or to identify and \r\nremediate insanitary conditions that already exist during manufacturing and distribution. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors and the Office of Regulations and Policy \r\nin the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 2 Pigments, which are color additives regulated by FDA, are a component of finished tattoo inks. This guidance \r\nfocuses on microbial contamination of finished inks.",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\nDraft-Not for Implementation \r\n 4 \r\n \r\nFDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable \r\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be \r\nviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. II. Background \r\n \r\nHuman skin is composed of multiple layers, including the epidermis, or outermost skin layer that \r\nserves as the body’s primary physical barrier against pathogens and other harms; and the dermis, \r\nor deeper layer that contains, among other things, blood and lymphatic vessels. Microorganisms \r\nare normally present on the epidermis, but not in deeper skin layers, such as the dermis. Microorganisms normally regarded as nonpathogenic when applied topically may become \r\nopportunistically pathogenic and virulent when introduced in other ways (e.g., in wounds or via \r\ncosmetics introduced into or through the skin).3  The presence of microorganisms in deeper skin \r\nlayers may give rise to infection and inflammation. Tattooing involves puncturing the epidermis about 100 times per second with needles and \r\ndepositing ink 1.5 to 2 millimeters below the surface of the skin, deep into the dermis (Ref. 3). It \r\ngenerally causes bleeding because the needles pierce the blood vessels (Refs. 4 and 5). Contaminated tattoo ink can cause infections and serious injuries. Because these inks are \r\ninjected, pathogens or other harmful substances in these inks can travel from the injection site \r\nthrough the blood and lymphatic systems to other parts of the body. Commonly reported \r\nsymptoms of tattoo ink-associated infections include injection-site rashes and other lesions, \r\nincluding blisters and granulomas, some of which have resulted in permanent scarring. Tattoo-\r\nassociated microbiological infections can also include impetigo,4 erysipelas,5 cellulitis,6 and \r\nsystemic infections that can cause life-threatening complications such as endocarditis, septic \r\nshock, and multi-organ failure (Ref. 8). Indications of an infection can be difficult to recognize, \r\nas other conditions (e.g., allergic reactions or other sources of inflammation) may initially have \r\nsimilar signs and symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments. We have received multiple reports of illness caused by microbially contaminated tattoo inks, and \r\nsubsequent testing has found many sealed tattoo inks in the United States with microbial \r\ncontamination. For instance, in 2012, contaminated tattoo inks caused a multi-state outbreak of \r\nnontuberculous mycobacterial skin infections (Ref. 9). Nontuberculous mycobacterial skin \r\ninfections can produce a range of symptoms, from mild inflammation (e.g., rash, papules, \r\n \r\n3 See Subpart J, “Microbiological Findings,” in Bacteriological Analytical Manual, Chapter 23: Methods for \r\nCosmetics, available at https://www.fda.gov/food/laboratory-methods-food/bam-chapter-23-methods-cosmetics \r\n(accessed January 5, 2022). 4 Impetigo is a contagious superficial pus-forming bacterial infection which begins with a superficial blister that \r\nruptures and forms a yellowish crust (Ref. 6). 5 Erysipelas is a specific, acute, superficial infection of the skin caused by bacterium and characterized by hot, red, \r\nswollen, thickened, and sharply defined eruptions (Ref. 6). 6 Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area of the \r\nskin. If untreated, it can spread and cause serious health problems (Ref. 7).",

Between 2003 and 2019, tattoo ink firms conducted 15 voluntary ink \r\nrecalls, 14 of which resulted from findings of microbial contamination. Eight of these recalls \r\n(Refs. 11-16) occurred after FDA conducted multiple surveys of tattoo inks available in the U.S. market and tested them for microbial contamination. Many of these inks were heavily \r\ncontaminated with a variety of microorganisms, some of which (such as Pseudomonas \r\naeruginosa and Bacillus cereus) can cause serious infections (Refs. 16 and 17). In 2018, an \r\narticle in the Journal of Applied Microbiology reported that 49 percent of the surveyed tattoo \r\ninks on the U.S. market were contaminated with microorganisms (Ref. 17). In 2019, we alerted \r\nconsumers, tattoo artists, and retailers of the potential for serious injury from use of certain tattoo \r\ninks contaminated with bacteria, and we worked with manufacturers and retailers to remove the \r\nproducts from the market (Ref. 16).8 \r\n \r\nFacilities where tattoo inks are prepared, packed, or held are responsible for ensuring that the \r\ntattoo inks are not prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby the tattoo ink \r\nmay become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. Tattoo inks prepared, packed, or held under such conditions are adulterated under the FD&C \r\nAct. Therefore, upon identification, such insanitary conditions would need to be remediated. III. Discussion \r\n \r\nA. General Considerations \r\n \r\nIn evaluating whether tattoo inks are adulterated because they have been prepared, packed, or \r\nheld under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth, or \r\nwhereby they may have been rendered injurious to health, we generally consider the following \r\nfactors: \r\n \r\n• Tattoo inks are used by a wide variety of consumers. Therefore, when evaluating the \r\npotential harms associated with tattoo inks, we consider use by any person, including \r\nanyone who may be immunocompromised or have other relevant underlying medical \r\nconditions. • Tattoo inks bypass the body’s primary physical barrier against pathogens, because they \r\nare inserted below the epidermis. • Pathogens that may cause no harm in a topical product may cause harm when inserted \r\nbelow the epidermis because of their type or amount. 7 Debridement is the removal, usually via surgery, of torn, dead, or contaminated tissue (Ref. 10). 8 Note that the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, § 3502 (2022)) establishes new requirements for the reporting to FDA of serious adverse events \r\nassociated with the use of cosmetic products.",

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind \r\nFDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the \r\napplicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff \r\nresponsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the \r\ntelephone number listed on the title page of this guidance. I. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE \r\n \r\nNanotechnology is an emerging technology that can be used in a broad array of FDA-regulated \r\nproducts, including medical products (e.g. to increase bioavailability of a drug), foods (e.g., to \r\nimprove food packaging) and cosmetics (e.g. to affect the look and feel of cosmetics). Materials \r\nin the nanoscale range (i.e., with at least one dimension in the size range of approximately 1 \r\nnanometer (nm) to 100 nm) can exhibit different chemical or physical properties, or biological \r\neffects compared to larger-scale counterparts. For example, dimension-dependent properties or \r\nphenomena may be used for functional effects such as increased bioavailability, decreased \r\ndosage, or increased potency of a drug product, decreased toxicity of a drug product, better \r\ndetection of pathogens, more protective food packaging materials, or improved delivery of a \r\nfunctional ingredient or a nutrient in food (Refs. 1-6). These effects may derive from altered \r\nchemical, biological, or magnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased \r\nstructural integrity, or other unique characteristics of materials in the nanoscale range not \r\nnormally observed or expected in larger-scale materials with the same chemical composition \r\n(Ref. 7). Materials or end products may also exhibit similar properties or phenomena attributable \r\nto a dimension(s) outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm (Refs. 27-30; see \r\nalso discussion in Section II.B.5). For the purpose of this guidance only, references to “products that involve the application of \r\nnanotechnology” or “nanotechnology products” mean products that contain or are manufactured \r\nusing materials in the nanoscale range, as well as products that contain or are manufactured using \r\ncertain materials that otherwise exhibit related dimension-dependent properties or phenomena. Likewise, we use the term “nanomaterial” generally to refer to both materials in the nanoscale \r\n                                                 \r\n1 This guidance finalizes the draft guidance, entitled “Draft Guidance for Industry: Considering Whether an FDA-\r\nRegulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology,” which was issued in June, 2011. This guidance \r\nwas prepared by FDA’s Office of Policy in the Office of the Commissioner, in consultation with FDA’s Center for \r\nBiologics Evaluation and Research, Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research, Center for Devices and Radiological \r\nHealth, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for Tobacco Products, Center for Veterinary \r\nMedicine, National Center for Toxicological Research, Office of the Chief Scientist, Office of Foods and Veterinary \r\nMedicine, Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of Special Medical Programs, and Nanotechnology Task Force.",

Use of these terms is for the purpose of communicating FDA’s current thinking \r\nelaborated in this document only. As used in this guidance, the word “products” (or “FDA-regulated products”) is meant to include \r\nproducts, materials, ingredients, and other substances regulated by FDA, including drugs, \r\nbiological products, medical devices, food substances (including food for animals), dietary \r\nsupplements, cosmetic products, and tobacco products.2   \r\n \r\nThe guidance describes FDA’s current thinking on determining whether FDA-regulated products \r\ninvolve the application of nanotechnology. This guidance is intended for manufacturers, \r\nsuppliers, importers, and other stakeholders. (For convenience, the guidance will refer to these \r\nparties as “industry. ”)  FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish \r\nlegally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe FDA’s current \r\nthinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or \r\nstatutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents \r\nmeans that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of \r\nconventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination. However, \r\nFDA (or “we”) does not categorically judge all products that involve the application of \r\nnanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. FDA will regulate nanotechnology products \r\nunder existing statutory authorities, in accordance with the specific legal standards applicable to \r\neach type of product under its jurisdiction. We consider the current framework for safety \r\nassessment sufficiently robust and flexible to be appropriate for a variety of materials, including \r\nnanomaterials. FDA maintains a product-focused, science-based regulatory policy. Technical \r\nassessments will be product-specific, taking into account the effects of nanomaterials in the \r\nparticular biological and mechanical context of each product and its intended use. As such, the \r\nparticular policies for each product area, both substantive and procedural, will vary according to \r\nthe statutory authorities and relevant regulatory frameworks (Ref. 8). We believe that this \r\nregulatory policy allows for tailored approaches that adhere to applicable legal frameworks and \r\nreflect the characteristics of specific products or product classes and evolving technology and \r\nscientific understanding. This guidance provides an overarching framework for FDA’s approach to the regulation of \r\nnanotechnology products. It identifies two points to consider when determining whether the \r\nFDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology. An affirmative finding to \r\neither of the Points to Consider, elaborated in section II below, might suggest the need for \r\nparticular attention by the Agency and/or industry to the product to identify and address potential \r\nimplications for safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the product. This guidance does not address, or presuppose, what ultimate regulatory outcome, if any, will \r\nresult in a particular case where the use of these points may indicate that an FDA-regulated \r\nproduct involves the application of nanotechnology. Issues such as the safety, effectiveness, \r\n                                                 \r\n2 Nanotechnology may also be applied to combination products (as defined at 21 CFR 3.2(e)).",

Rather, it is intended to help \r\nindustry and others identify when they should consider potential implications for regulatory \r\nstatus, safety, effectiveness, or public health impact that may arise with the application of \r\nnanotechnology in FDA-regulated products. We advise industry to consult with FDA early in \r\nthe development process to facilitate a mutual understanding of the specific scientific and \r\nregulatory issues for their nanotechnology products. FDA will provide further guidance to industry, as needed, to address the application of \r\nnanotechnology as applicable to specific FDA-regulated products or classes of products (such as \r\nhuman foods, drugs, or cosmetics), consistent with existing federal policies (Refs. 9, 10). As \r\nappropriate, FDA’s product-specific guidance documents will address issues such as the \r\nregulatory status, safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, or public health impact of \r\nnanotechnology products.4   \r\n \r\n \r\nII. DISCUSSION \r\n \r\nFDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,” \r\n“nanoscale,” or other related terms. These terms are commonly used in relation to the \r\nengineering (i.e., deliberate manipulation, manufacture or selection) of materials that have at \r\nleast one dimension in the size range of approximately 1 nanometers (nm) to 100 nm. For \r\nexample, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Program defines nanotechnology as “the \r\nunderstanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 \r\nnanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications” (Ref. 11). Various published \r\ndefinitions mention other factors such as function, shape, charge, the ratio of surface area to \r\nvolume, or other physical or chemical properties. Based on our current scientific and technical understanding of nanomaterials and their \r\ncharacteristics, FDA believes that evaluations of safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or \r\nregulatory status of nanotechnology products should consider any unique properties and \r\nbehaviors that the application of nanotechnology may impart. This guidance identifies two \r\nPoints to Consider that should be used to evaluate whether FDA-regulated products involve the \r\napplication of nanotechnology. These points address both particle dimensions and dimension-\r\ndependent properties or phenomena. Product-specific premarket review, when required, offers \r\nan opportunity for FDA to apply these points and, where products are not subject to premarket \r\nreview, industry should consider these points. If either point applies to a given product, industry \r\n                                                 \r\n3 It bears noting that the application of nanotechnology may also affect the classification of a product. For example, \r\nnanomaterials used in medical products may function through different modes of action than larger-scale materials \r\nwith the same chemical composition, which may affect the classification of the product, for example as a drug or \r\ndevice. 4 FDA’s guidance documents relevant to nanotechnology, including product-specific guidance documents that focus \r\non nanotechnology applications in specific product sectors, can be found at: \r\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/default.htm",

This may \r\ninclude refining particle size parameters or introducing additional parameters such as those \r\nrelated to particle size distribution or specific properties.5  We will consider future revisions to \r\nour approach, including developing regulatory definitions relevant to nanotechnology, as \r\nwarranted and in keeping with evolving scientific understanding. As previously indicated, FDA \r\nalso may provide additional guidance, including product-specific guidance documents, to address \r\nissues such as the regulatory status, safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, or public health \r\nimpact of nanotechnology products. A. Points to Consider \r\n \r\nAt this time, when considering whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of \r\nnanotechnology, FDA will ask:  \r\n \r\n1. Whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external dimension, or \r\nan internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm); \r\n \r\nIn addition, as we explain in more detail below, because materials or end products can also \r\nexhibit related properties or phenomena attributable to a dimension(s) outside the nanoscale \r\nrange of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm that are relevant to evaluations of safety, effectiveness, \r\nperformance, quality, public health impact, or regulatory status of products, we will also ask: \r\n \r\n2. Whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or phenomena, \r\nincluding physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are attributable to its \r\ndimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up to one \r\nmicrometer (1,000 nm).6   \r\n \r\n                                                 \r\n5 At this time, we do not have an adequate basis on which to determine a particle number threshold or a list of \r\n“unique” or “novel” properties that are applicable across the range of FDA-regulated products. In addition, \r\nchallenges related to measurement methods and biological effects add further complexity to recommending use of \r\nparticle number, weight, or surface area as the most appropriate units of measure. FDA intends to actively follow \r\nscientific developments on this issue and provide additional guidance, as appropriate. 6 As explained in section II.B.5. below, the use of 1,000 nm as a reference point should not be interpreted to mean \r\nthat materials or products with dimensions above 1,000 nm cannot exhibit dimension-dependent properties or \r\nphenomena of importance to safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the material or \r\nproduct. See further discussion on this issue in section II.B.5. below.",

Rationale for Elements within the Points to Consider  \r\n \r\n1. Material or end product that is engineered to have certain dimensions or exhibit \r\ncertain properties (in Points 1 and 2) \r\n \r\nThe term “engineered,” used in both Points 1 and 2, is used to distinguish products that have \r\nbeen deliberately manipulated by the application of nanotechnology from those products that \r\ncontain materials that naturally occur in the nanoscale range. FDA is particularly interested in \r\nthe deliberate and purposeful manipulation and control of dimensions to produce specific \r\nproperties, because the emergence of these new properties or phenomena may raise questions \r\nabout the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality or public health impact that may warrant \r\nfurther evaluation. FDA’s interest in materials or products “engineered” to have nanoscale \r\ndimensions or related dimension-dependent properties or phenomena is distinct from the more \r\nfamiliar use of biological or chemical substances that may naturally exist at small scales, \r\nincluding at the nanoscale, such as microorganisms or proteins. The term “engineered” is also used to distinguish products that have been deliberately \r\nmanipulated by the application of nanotechnology from products that may unintentionally \r\ninclude materials in the nanoscale range. For example, the incidental presence of particles in the nanoscale range in conventionally-\r\nmanufactured products8 is not covered under the scope of this guidance.9 \r\n \r\n2. Material or end product (in Points 1 and 2) \r\n \r\nThe phrase “material or end product,” referred to in both Points 1 and 2, is used to cover \r\ndifferent types of articles that are regulated by FDA, such as products, materials, ingredients, and \r\nother substances regulated by FDA. This includes finished products (e.g., a drug tablet for \r\nadministration to a patient) as well as materials that are intended for use in a finished product \r\n(e.g., a food additive added to a food during processing). In determining whether a material or \r\nend product satisfies either Point 1 or Point 2, FDA will examine the material or end product, \r\nand may also consider the constituent parts of the material or end product. Therefore, relevant \r\nconsiderations include whether a material or end product contains or involves in its manufacture \r\nthe use of materials that meet either Point 1 or Point 2. 7 These Points to Consider are not intended to apply to products that have been previously reviewed or approved by \r\nFDA and where no changes are made to manufacturing processes that would alter the dimensions, properties or \r\neffects of the product or its constituent parts. 8 For example, small amounts of particles in the nanoscale range have been reported to be present in foods \r\nmanufactured using conventional food manufacturing practices (Ref. 12). 9 However, evaluations of conventionally-manufactured products may include a consideration of the effects, if any, \r\nof such incidental presence of particles in the nanoscale range on the safety, effectiveness, or public health impact of \r\na product.",

At least one external dimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the \r\nnanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm) (in Point 1) \r\n \r\nA size range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm is commonly used in various working definitions \r\nor descriptions regarding nanotechnology proposed by the regulatory and scientific \r\ncommunity.10  In this size range, materials can exhibit new or altered physicochemical properties \r\nthat can enable novel applications (Refs. 11, 13-15). Accordingly, per Point 1, if a material or \r\nend product is engineered to have at least one external dimension in the range of 1 nm to 100 nm, \r\nor is engineered to have an internal or surface structure in the range of 1 nm to 100 nm, industry \r\nand FDA should consider any unique characteristics or biological effects exhibited by the \r\nproduct that may influence its safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status. Primary particles engineered with at least one external dimension within the nanoscale range are \r\ncovered in Point 1. This Point also covers any aggregates or agglomerates formed by such \r\nnanoscale primary particles. In addition, coated, functionalized, or hierarchically-assembled \r\nengineered structures that include internal or surface discrete and functional nanoscale entities, \r\nsuch as where such entities are embedded or attached to the surface, are encompassed within \r\nPoint 1.11  Such engineered structures with discrete and functional nanoscale entities embedded \r\nor attached to the surface may have altered properties or phenomena that may affect product \r\nsafety or effectiveness (Ref. 16). The inclusion of particles, objects, or structures with internal, \r\nsurface, or external dimension(s) in the nanoscale range is consistent with approaches taken by \r\nother scientific and regulatory bodies (Refs. 17-23). 4. Properties or phenomena attributable to dimension(s) (in Point 2) \r\n \r\nWhile size alone, for very small particles, is suggestive of the presence of properties meriting \r\nfurther examination, the identification and assessment of specific dimension-dependent \r\nproperties and phenomena are ultimately more relevant for purposes of FDA regulatory review \r\nand oversight. Point 2, therefore, focuses on the properties of the material and its behavior in \r\nbiological systems.12  The phrase “exhibits properties or phenomena . . . that are attributable to \r\nits dimension(s),” is used because properties and phenomena of materials in the nanoscale range \r\nenable applications that can affect the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, public health \r\nimpact, or regulatory status of FDA-regulated products. For example, as noted above, \r\ndimension-dependent properties or phenomena may be used for various functional effects such \r\nas increased bioavailability or decreased toxicity of drug products, better detection of pathogens, \r\n                                                 \r\n10 For example, a size range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm is used in definitions, working definitions, or \r\ndescriptions published by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (Ref. 11); Environmental Protection Agency \r\n(http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/nanotechnology.html); European Commission (Ref. 17); Health Canada \r\n(Ref. 19); International Standards Organization (Ref. 20); Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment’s Working Party on Nanotechnology and Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials \r\n(http://www.oecd.org/sti/nano/); National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=445071); and \r\nAmerican National Standards Institute (http://nanostandards.ansi.org/tiki-index.php). 11 This is not intended to include any incidental presence of internal or surface features with dimensions in the \r\nnanoscale range that may be present in conventionally-manufactured substances (for example, internal porosity, \r\nsurface roughness or surface defects). 12 Consistent with “Policy Principles for the U.S. Decision-Making Concerning Regulation and Oversight of \r\nApplications of Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials,” Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of \r\nManagement and Budget, and Office of the United States Trade Representative, June 9, 2011 (Ref. 10).",

These effects may derive \r\nfrom altered or unique characteristics of materials in the nanoscale range that are not normally \r\nobserved or expected in larger-scale materials with the same chemical composition (Ref. 7). However, such changes may raise questions about the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality \r\nor public health impact of nanotechnology products. In addition, considerations such as routes of \r\nexposure, dosage, and behavior in various biological systems (including specific tissues and \r\norgans) (Refs. 13, 24) are critical for evaluating the safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or \r\nregulatory status of a wide array of products under FDA’s jurisdiction. Such evaluations should \r\ninclude a consideration of the specific tests (whether traditional, modified, or new) that may be \r\nneeded (Refs. 25, 26) to determine the physicochemical properties and biological effects of a \r\nproduct that involves the application of nanotechnology. 5. Dimension(s) of up to one micrometer (1,000 nm) (in Point 2) \r\n \r\nMaterials or end products can also exhibit properties or phenomena attributable to a dimension(s) \r\noutside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm. Physical and chemical properties \r\nand biological behavior that are relevant to evaluations of safety, effectiveness, performance, \r\nquality, public health impact, or regulatory status of products have been observed at dimensions \r\noutside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm (Refs. 27-30). Therefore, Point 2 \r\nfocuses on the importance of considering properties or phenomena attributable to dimensions, \r\neven where such dimensions may be outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 \r\nnm. FDA’s consideration of materials with dimension(s) outside the nanoscale range of \r\napproximately 1 nm to 100 nm is consistent with approaches taken by other scientific and \r\nregulatory organizations.13   \r\n                                                 \r\n13 For example, the Joint Research Centre and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health \r\nRisks of the European Commission concluded: “In order to base a nanomaterials definition for regulatory purposes \r\non size alone, the upper nanoscale limit should ideally be high enough to capture all types of materials that would \r\nneed particular attention for regulation due to their nanoscale size. Upper limits which are often used in existing \r\ndefinitions, for example 100 nm, may require the introduction of one or more qualifiers based on structural features \r\nor properties other than size, in order to capture structures of concern (for example agglomerates or aggregates) with \r\na size larger than 100 nm in the regulation” (Ref. 22); “The upper size limit for one or more external dimensions of \r\n100 nm is complicated by the potential exclusion of aggregates, agglomerates and multicomponent assemblies that \r\nwould have external sizes greater than this” (Ref. 23); and “An upper limit of 100 nm is commonly used by general \r\nconsensus but there is no scientific evidence to support the appropriateness of this value (Stated as SCENIHR \r\nconclusions in the European Commission Recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial, Ref. 17). The \r\nEuropean Commission further noted that “it may be necessary to include additional materials, such as some \r\nmaterials with a size . . . greater than 100 nm in the scope of application of specific legislation or legislative \r\nprovisions suited for a nanomaterial (Ref. 17). In addition, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \r\n“acknowledged that health and safety considerations associated with intentionally produced and incidental nano-\r\nobjects do not abruptly end at dimensions of 100 nm. As knowledge expands, it is abundantly clear that a robust \r\nterminology will need to capture and convey effectively the performance aspects of intentionally produced nano-\r\nobjects and nanostructured materials in their definitions, apart from their fundamental size and shape” (Ref. 20). More recently, Health Canada adopted a working definition of nanomaterial that, in part, reflects that it is possible \r\nfor nanoscale properties/ phenomena to be exhibited outside the 1 nm to 100 nm size range, such as select quantum \r\ndevices (Ref. 19). Finally, in its second regulatory review on nanomaterials, the European Commission noted that \r\n“fullerenes, graphene flakes and single wall carbon nanotubes with one or more external dimensions below 1 nm \r\nshould be considered as nanomaterials. ” Several types of nanomaterials were identified as not matching the EU \r\ndefinition, with an acknowledgment that “there are an increasing number of particles which are engineered to have \r\ninternal nanoscale features.

An upper limit of 1,000 nm, combined with the presence of dimension-dependent properties or \r\nphenomena similar to those seen in materials with dimensions in the nanoscale range, provides \r\nan initial screening tool to help identify materials or products with properties or phenomena of \r\nparticular relevance for regulatory review. The use of 1,000 nm as a reference point in this \r\ncontext should not be interpreted to mean that materials or products with dimensions above \r\n1,000 nm cannot exhibit dimension-dependent properties or phenomena of importance to safety, \r\neffectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the material or product. As noted \r\nabove, we may further refine these Points to Consider, including this upper limit, either as \r\napplicable broadly to FDA-regulated products or as applicable to specific products or product \r\ncategories. III. CONCLUSION \r\n \r\nThe two Points to Consider elaborated in this guidance should be applied when considering \r\nwhether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology. An affirmative \r\nfinding to either of the Points to Consider, elaborated in this guidance, might suggest the need for \r\nparticular attention to the product by FDA and/or industry for potential implications for safety, \r\neffectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the product. We will consider future \r\nrevisions to our approach, including developing regulatory definitions relevant to \r\nnanotechnology, as warranted and in keeping with evolving scientific understanding. There remains a need to learn more about the potential role and importance of dimensions in the \r\nphysical and chemical characteristics and biological effects exhibited by FDA-regulated products \r\n                                                                                                                                                             \r\nenvironment. Some of these materials have an external diameter smaller than 100 nm, matching the EU \r\nnanomaterial definition, others have an external diameter larger than 100 nm, not matching the EU nanomaterial \r\ndefinition” (Ref. 31). 14 However, as noted previously, FDA will consider further refinement of these Points to Consider for particular \r\nproducts or classes of products, as scientific information becomes available, including refining particle size \r\nparameters.",

Where products that involve the \r\napplication of nanotechnology are not subject to premarket review, we urge industry to consult \r\nwith the Agency early in the product development process. In this way, any questions about the \r\nproducts’ regulatory status, safety, effectiveness, or public health impact can be appropriately \r\nand adequately addressed. FDA has and, as needed, will continue to provide additional guidance \r\nto industry in more targeted guidance documents to address these considerations. IV.

It does not establish any rights for any person \r\nand is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the \r\nrequirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, \r\ncontact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. INTRODUCTION  \r\n \r\nThis draft guidance is intended to assist FDA staff and industry with issues and questions related \r\nto the requirements for FDA to collect and provide portions of official samples under section \r\n702(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and its implementing regulation \r\nin Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 2.10 (21 CFR 2.10). The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant \r\nto bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This \r\ndocument is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements \r\nunder the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only \r\nas recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The \r\nuse of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or \r\nrecommended, but not required. BACKGROUND  \r\n \r\nSection 702 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 372) authorizes FDA to conduct examinations and \r\ninvestigations and to collect samples.1  Collecting samples is a critical part of FDA's regulatory \r\nactivities. Under section 702(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 372(b)), when FDA collects a \r\nsample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis, FDA must, “upon request, provide a part of \r\nsuch official sample for examination or analysis by any person named on the label of the article, \r\nor the owner thereof, or his attorney or agent” (hereinafter referred to as “owner”). Section \r\n702(b) of the FD&C Act also authorizes FDA to establish, by regulation, “reasonable exceptions \r\n \r\n1 Courts have recognized that the plain language of section 702(b) of the FD&C Act authorizes sampling. See, e.g., \r\nUnited States v. 75 cases, etc., 146 F.2d 124 (4th Cir. 1944).",

FDA’s regulation at 21 CFR 2.10 was established to describe those reasonable terms and \r\nconditions to implement section 702(b) of the FD&C Act. The regulation provides a definition \r\nfor official sample, states when FDA must collect and provide a part of the official sample \r\n(hereinafter referred to as the 702(b) portion) to the owner, and states when FDA may destroy \r\nthe official sample, among other things. The regulation also provides exceptions to the \r\nrequirement for FDA to collect and provide a 702(b) portion of an official sample to the owner. A. TERMINOLOGY  \r\n \r\n1. What is a 702(b) portion? FDA uses the term 702(b) portion to refer to the part of FDA’s official sample of a food, drug, or \r\ncosmetic that FDA is required to provide to the owner, upon request under section 702(b) of the \r\nFD&C Act. FDA will collect and provide a 702(b) portion in accordance with 702(b) of the \r\nFD&C Act and its implementing regulation in 21 CFR 2.10. 2. What is an official sample? A sample collected by an officer or employee of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \r\nServices (HHS) is an official sample if records or other evidence is obtained by the officer or \r\nemployee or any other officer or employee of HHS indicating that the shipment or other lot of \r\nthe article from which the sample is collected was introduced or delivered for introduction into \r\ninterstate commerce, or was in or was received in interstate commerce, or was manufactured \r\nwithin a Territory as defined in section 201(a)(2) of the FD&C Act. 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1). The \r\nofficer or employee of HHS must designate such sample as an official sample for it to be \r\nconsidered one. 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1). FDA personnel can refer to FDA’s Investigations \r\nOperations Manual (IOM), Chapter 4, for instructions related to official samples. 3. What is a food, drug, or cosmetic? The FD&C Act defines food, drug, and cosmetic in pertinent part as:    \r\n• Food means “(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing \r\ngum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article” (section 201(f)); For \r\nexample,",

FDA occasionally performs environmental sampling (e.g. swabbing of facilities or equipment) to \r\nidentify the presence of chemicals or microbes where food, drugs, or cosmetics are produced. These environmental samples do not meet the definitions of food, drug, or cosmetic. B. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  \r\n1. When must FDA collect a 702(b) portion? FDA must collect a 702(b) portion when an officer or employee of HHS collects an official \r\nsample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the FD&C Act, unless an exception in 21 \r\nCFR 2.10(b) applies (See B.3.). i. Must a commissioned state or local official collect a 702(b) portion \r\nwhen collecting an official sample? 2 Section 201(ff)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)) excludes from the definition of a dietary \r\nsupplement a product that contains an article that was the subject of an investigational new drug exemption, new \r\ndrug application, or biologics license application 1) approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act, \r\ncertified as an antibiotic under 507 of the FD&C Act, or licensed as a biologic under section 351 of the Public \r\nHealth Service Act, or 2) investigated as a new drug, antibiotic or biologic for which substantial clinical \r\ninvestigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public; and \r\nwhich was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as \r\na food unless the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding \r\nthat the article would be lawful under the FD&C Actprior to its marketing as a dietary supplement. 3 A biological product, as defined in section 351(i)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), that is also \r\nregulated as a drug under the FD&C Act’s drug provisions is subject to section 702(b) (see section 351(j) of the PHS \r\nAct), as is a combination product that is subject to premarket approval under the FD&C Act’s drug provisions or the \r\nPHS Act’s biologics licensing provisions.",

          "text": "Contains Nonbinding Recommendations \r\n \r\nDraft – Not for Implementation \r\n \r\n5 \r\nSection 702(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act authorizes the Secretary of HHS to conduct examinations \r\nand inspections through officers and employees of HHS or through certain officers and \r\nemployees of states, territories, and political subdivisions who have been duly commissioned as \r\nan officer of HHS. Under section 702(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, state and local officials duly \r\ncommissioned by FDA are considered officers of HHS when conducting examinations or \r\ninvestigations under contract or agreement for purposes of the FD&C Act. Thus, a \r\ncommissioned state or local officer or employee who collects an official sample of a food, drug, \r\nor cosmetic for analysis under the FD&C Act must collect a 702(b) portion, as required by 21 \r\nCFR 2.10(b). This guidance uses the terms “FDA staff” and “FDA investigator” to refer to an \r\nHHS officer or employee, including a commissioned state or local officer or employee. ii. Should FDA collect a 702(b) portion if documentation of interstate \r\ncommerce is not immediately available? An FDA investigator must collect a 702(b) portion for an official sample, unless an exception \r\napplies. (See 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1) and section A.2. of this guidance for the meaning of official \r\nsample, which includes, among other things, evidence of interstate commerce. ) \r\n \r\nIn some situations, such as a retail setting or as part of FDA’s surveillance activities, records or \r\nevidence of interstate commerce may not be immediately available at the time of the sample \r\ncollection. However, if FDA has reason to believe that the product was introduced into or in \r\ninterstate commerce and expects to obtain evidence of interstate commerce at a later time, FDA \r\nshould collect a 702(b) portion for the sample. iii. What common types of samples does FDA collect that do not require a \r\n702(b) portion? FDA is not required to collect or provide a 702(b) portion for samples of products that are not \r\nfoods, drugs, or cosmetics as defined by the FD&C Act. (21 U.S.C. 372(b); 21 CFR 2.10(b)). See section A.3 of this guidance for the definitions of food, drug, and cosmetic. For example, \r\nFDA is not required to collect a 702(b) portion for a sample that is a medical device or a tobacco \r\nproduct. Other examples of samples collected by FDA that are not a food, drug, or cosmetic and thus are \r\nnot subject to section 702(b) of the FD&C Act include filth exhibits that are not tied to or \r\nconnected to a specific lot of product used to illustrate conditions at an establishment (e.g., \r\nrodent excreta pellets) and samples collected from equipment or surfaces to demonstrate the \r\nenvironmental conditions of an establishment. However, unless an exception in 21 CFR 2.10(b) \r\napplies, FDA must collect a 702(b) portion when collecting an official sample of a food, drug, or \r\ncosmetic that is associated with the filth or the environmental sample.",

An FDA investigator who is collecting an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for \r\nanalysis under the FD&C Act must collect at least twice the quantity estimated to be sufficient \r\nfor analysis, unless one of the following exceptions in 21 CFR 2.10(b) applies: \r\n \r\n(1) The amount of the article available and reasonably accessible for sampling is less than \r\ntwice the quantity so estimated, in which case the FDA investigator must collect as much \r\nas is available and reasonably accessible. Considerations:  For some samples, such as when FDA is collecting an official sample \r\nfrom retail, rather than from the owner, the amount of the article available and reasonably \r\naccessible for sampling is less than twice the quantity estimated to be sufficient for \r\nanalysis. Also, FDA may receive product from a consumer that the consumer alleges \r\nviolates the FD&C Act in some respect. The consumer may have a limited portion of the \r\narticle that is not sufficient to include a 702(b) portion. In these and other situations for \r\nwhich twice the quantity sufficient for analysis is not available, FDA should collect as \r\nmuch of the article that is available and reasonably accessible. (2) The cost of twice the quantity so estimated exceeds $150. Considerations:   If the cost of twice the quantity exceeds $150, FDA investigators \r\nshould consult with their supervisors (see IOM, Chapter 4). (3) The sample cannot by diligent use of practicable preservation techniques available to \r\nFDA be kept in a state in which it could be readily and meaningfully analyzed in the \r\nsame manner and for the same purposes as FDA’s analysis. Considerations: Whether the sample can be so preserved and analyzed may depend on \r\nthe product from which the sample was taken. For example, some FDA products, such as \r\nfresh produce, are highly perishable and cannot be kept in a state that allows for \r\nmeaningful analysis in the same manner and for the same purpose as the FDA’s analysis. (4) The sample is collected from a shipment or other lot which is being imported or \r\noffered for import into the United States. (5) The sample is collected from a person named on the label of the article or his agent, \r\nand such person is also the owner of the article. (6) The sample is collected from the owner of the article, or his agent, and such article \r\nbears no label or, if it bears a label, no person is named thereon. For exceptions (5) and (6), while FDA is not required to collect a 702(b) portion, the owners or \r\ntheir agents may decide at their own discretion to collect a sample to duplicate FDA’s sample. Such sampling by owners or their agents is outside the scope of this guidance.",

For example, if an official \r\nsample of an imported article, or article offered for import, is collected for use in an anticipated \r\nlegal action (e.g., seizure under section 304 of the FD&C Act), FDA may collect a 702(b) \r\nportion. 3. When FDA receives a food, drug, or cosmetic as part of a consumer complaint, \r\nshould FDA collect a 702(b) portion? Yes, when collecting an official sample from a consumer as part of a consumer complaint, FDA \r\nshould take reasonable efforts to collect a 702(b) portion if one is available and no exceptions \r\napply. 4. Does FDA collect the 702(b) portion as a separate subsample? FDA is not required to collect the 702(b) portion as a separate subsample. In some situations, \r\nwhen collecting, FDA may not be able to collect a separate subsample that will be used as the \r\n702(b) portion of the official sample. However, whenever possible, FDA may collect a separate subsample in order to provide the \r\nowner a 702(b) portion. See IOM Chapter 4. If FDA does not collect separate subsamples, FDA \r\nwill collect a single sample at least twice the amount estimated to be sufficient for analysis \r\nunless an exception applies.

Under 2.10(c), after FDA has completed all analysis of an official sample of a \r\nfood, drug, or cosmetic needed to determine whether the product is adulterated or misbranded, or \r\notherwise subject to the prohibitions of the FD&C Act, and has reserved an amount of the article \r\nit estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise based on the \r\nsample, a part of the sample, if any remains available, must be provided for analysis upon written \r\nrequest, by the owner, unless an exception applies. i. If the only portion of the official sample that remains after FDA \r\nanalysis is the amount reserved by FDA for use at trial, must FDA \r\nprovide that portion to the owner? No, FDA is not required to give a 702(b) portion to the owner if none remains after reserving an \r\nadequate amount for trial. Under such situations, FDA is not required to provide to the owner \r\nthe portion reserved by FDA for use at trial. (21 CFR 2.10(c)).",

If a portion of an official sample remains after FDA analysis and \r\nreserving an amount for use at trial, must FDA provide part of the \r\nsample upon written request by the owner? Yes, FDA must provide a portion of the official sample to the owner if any remains after \r\nreserving an amount for trial upon written request by the owner. (21 CFR 2.10(c)). iii. If the sample was collected from a consumer as part of a consumer \r\ncomplaint, must FDA provide a part of the sample to the consumer? In some consumer complaint situations, there is potential for litigation between the consumer and \r\nthe firm, in addition to any action FDA may be considering. In such situations, both the firm and \r\nthe consumer may request a part of the sample. FDA is required to provide a 702(b) portion if, in part, the request is from any person named on \r\nthe label of the article, or the owner thereof, or the attorney or agent of such person or owner. (21 \r\nU.S.C. 372(b)). 21 CFR 2.10(a)(3) states that the “owner of a food, drug, or cosmetic of which \r\nan official sample is collected is the person who owns the shipment or other lot of the article \r\nfrom which the sample is collected. ”  FDA may consider providing a portion of a sample to a \r\nconsumer who is not an owner but such portion is outside the scope of this guidance, and FDA \r\nmust prioritize providing a sample to persons entitled to a 702(b) portion under the FD&C Act. 6. If FDA is required to provide a 702(b) portion, how much should FDA provide? 21 CFR 2.10(c) states, in part, that FDA must provide “a part of the sample” to the owner upon \r\nwritten requests, unless an exception applies. The amount of a sample that remains for providing \r\na 702(b) portion depends on the amount of sample collected, the amount of the sample used for \r\nthe analysis, and the amount of the sample reserved for trial. The amount reserved for trial is \r\nwhat FDA estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise \r\nunder the FD&C Act based on the sample and will be determined at FDA’s discretion. If it is not possible to provide the amount requested by the owner, FDA should consult with the \r\nowner to determine how much of the remaining sample the owner may want as a 702(b) portion. 7. If FDA collected one or more separate subsamples as the 702(b) portion, but the \r\nowner requests a portion of the subsample FDA used for the sample analysis, \r\nshould FDA provide the portion the owner requested? Although not required, FDA’s practice is to, whenever reasonable, collect separate subsamples to \r\nserve as the 702(b) portion. Also see section B.5. If FDA collected a separate subsample as the 702(b) portion but the owner requests a portion \r\nfrom the subsample FDA used for analysis, FDA may provide the owner the portion from the \r\nsource requested, if any remains available after analysis and reserving an amount adequate for",

FDA Divisions receiving such requests may consult within FDA about the \r\ncircumstances pertaining to the request. 8. How long should a 702(b) portion be retained? FDA should retain the 702(b) portion until it is authorized to destroy it. Under 21 CFR 2.10(e), \r\nFDA is authorized to destroy an official sample, including the 702(b) portion, as follows: \r\n \r\na. FDA determines that no analysis of the sample will be made; \r\nb. FDA determines that no notice under section 305 of the FD&C Act and no case under the \r\nFD&C Act, is or will be based on the sample; \r\nc. The sample was the basis of a notice under section 305 of the FD&C Act and, after \r\nopportunity for presentation of views following such notice, FDA determines that no \r\nother such notice, and no case under the FD&C Act, is or will be based on the sample; \r\nd. The sample was the basis of a case under the FD&C Act that has gone to final judgment, \r\nand FDA has determined that no other such case is or will be based on the sample; \r\ne. The sampled article is perishable; \r\nf. The sample is decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis; \r\ng. The part of the sample that will be destroyed is in excess of three times the quantity FDA \r\nestimates to be sufficient for analysis. 9. Can FDA use 702(b) portions of a sample for research purposes? Yes, FDA may use an official sample, including the 702(b) portion, for research purposes, \r\nprovided that the conditions for destruction under 21 CFR 2.10(e) are met. In such situations, \r\nbecause FDA has met the conditions for destruction, the owner is no longer entitled to the 702(b) \r\nportion of the sample. 10. How should the owner request a 702(b) portion? The owner should send a request for the 702(b) portion of an official sample to the FDA \r\nDivision4 of the officer or employee who collected the sample. The request can be addressed to \r\nthe Division’s Director of Compliance.5  The request for a 702(b) portion must be in writing \r\n(e.g., electronic mail or letter) and be accompanied by either a showing of ownership of the \r\nsample or the authority to receive the sample on behalf of the owner (21 CFR 2.10(c)). The \r\nrequest should also include relevant details regarding the sample (e.g., the lot, serial number, \r\nmodel number, or other identification of the sampled product). The owner who requests the \r\n702(b) portion must specify the amount desired. (21 CFR 2.10(c)(2)). In addition to the request, \r\n \r\n4 FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) staff are assigned to program areas, where they specialize in a \r\ncommodity. Each program area is organized by Divisions.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You \r\ncan use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible  for this guidance as listed on the \r\ntitle page. I. Introduction \r\n \r\nThis guidance1 describes FDA implementation of the revised provisions applicable to the request \r\nfor, and issuance of, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures \r\nAct) (Public Law 114-255) amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), section 301(d) \r\n(42 U.S.C. 241(d)) relating to the issuance of CoCs. A CoC is intended to help protect the \r\nprivacy of human subject research participants from whom identifiable, sensitive information is \r\nbeing collected or used in furtherance of the research.2  Historically, a CoC generally protected a \r\nresearcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information about the research \r\nparticipant, created or compiled for purposes of the human subject research. As amended, the \r\nstatute broadened the protections by affirmatively prohibiting holders of CoCs from disclosing \r\nsuch information unless a specific exception applies. The Cures Act simplified certain aspects of the issuance of CoCs by requiring that CoCs be \r\nissued for federally-funded human subject research that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive \r\ninformation (referred to in this guidance as mandatory CoCs). For non-federally funded \r\nresearch, issuance of CoCs is not required but may be issued at the discretion of FDA (referred to \r\nin this guidance as discretionary CoCs). FDA intends to continue receiving and considering such \r\nrequests and will issue discretionary CoCs as appropriate. This guidance is intended to provide \r\ninformation on how to request a discretionary CoC, the statutory requirements for requesting \r\nsuch a CoC, and the statutory responsibilities associated with possessing a CoC. Although the \r\nmandatory CoC and the discretionary CoC are issued under different processes, the protections \r\n                                                 \r\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Policy in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation \r\nand Research, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the \r\nCenter for Tobacco Products, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the Center for Veterinary Medicine, \r\nand the Office of Chief Scientist at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 There are additional statutes and regulations that protect the privacy of human subject research participants. These \r\nare outside the scope of this guidance.",

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only \r\nas recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of \r\nthe word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but \r\nnot required. II. Background \r\n \r\nA CoC generally protects a researcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive \r\ninformation about the research participant, created or compiled for purposes of the research, in \r\nany Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. As \r\namended, the statute broadened these protections by prohibiting disclosure of such information. By protecting researchers from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information \r\nabout the research participants, CoCs help protect the identity of the research participants and \r\nachieve the objectives of the research. There are exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure as \r\ndescribed in Section III of this guidance. FDA has the authority (by delegation) to issue CoCs related to the study of products subject to \r\nFDA jurisdiction and to which FDA regulations apply, in compliance with the PHS Act, and has \r\ndone so for over 20 years. (42 U.S.C. § 241)3 The Cures Act revisions made issuance of a CoC \r\nmandatory for federally funded researchers “engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other \r\nresearch, in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected (including research on mental \r\nhealth and research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs). ”  For non-\r\nfederally funded research, FDA “may, upon application by a person engaged in research, issue to \r\nsuch person a certificate of confidentiality to protect the privacy of such individuals (emphases \r\nadded) . . . . ”  \r\n \r\nThe Cures Act also directed agencies to take steps to minimize the burden to researchers, \r\nstreamline the process, and reduce the time it takes to comply with the requirements of the \r\nstatutory provision. FDA has complied with this directive in implementing requirements for the \r\nissuance of mandatory CoCs to FDA-federally funded researchers. For non-federally funded research, FDA has been issuing discretionary CoCs pursuant to the \r\namended statutory requirements, on a case-by-case basis upon application to FDA, since \r\nenactment of the Cures Act. This guidance describes the revised, streamlined process for \r\nsubmission to FDA of requests for discretionary CoCs for non-federally funded research. The \r\nrevised process for discretionary CoCs will minimize the burden to researchers who request a \r\nCoC, will streamline the existing process by reducing the information currently provided in a \r\nrequest to FDA for a CoC, will clarify the statutory responsibilities associated with receiving a \r\nCoC and, thus, will reduce the time it takes to obtain a CoC. 3 FDA, by delegation from the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the authority to \r\nissue CoCs . (See, FDA Staff Manual Guide, 1410.26(1)(E)). Other HHS agencies, e.g., National Institutes of \r\nHealth (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also issue CoCs.",

Scope   \r\n  \r\nTo help ensure that discretionary CoCs are issued to those entities who can comply with the \r\nrequirements of the statutory provision, we recommend that only sponsors or sponsor-\r\ninvestigators, submit requests for discretionary CoCs (as defined in 21 CFR §50.3, §312.3, \r\n§812.3) (i.e., the individual who takes responsibility for or initiates the clinical investigation). This will help eliminate duplicative requests to FDA for the same human subject research. It is \r\nour understanding that, typically, sponsors and sponsor-investigators are the entities or \r\nindividuals who have responsibility and control over the information and data collected and used \r\nin research. Furthermore, the human subject research, for which a discretionary CoC is being \r\nrequested, must involve the use or study of a product subject to FDA’s jurisdiction and must be \r\nsubject to FDA’s regulatory authority. The term “identifiable, sensitive information,” as used in section 301(d), PHS Act, and in \r\nrelation to CoCs, means “information that is about an individual and that is gathered or used \r\nduring the course of research” covered by the statute and  \r\n \r\n(A) through which an individual is identified; or (B) for which there is at least a very \r\nsmall risk, as determined by current scientific practices or statistical methods, that some \r\ncombination of the information, a request for the information, and other available data \r\nsources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual. (42 U.S.C. § 241(d)(4)). An entity or individual requesting a discretionary CoC should evaluate \r\nits own human subject research and make its own determination as to whether the research \r\ninvolves the collection of identifiable, sensitive information (e.g., research participant names). This evaluation should take into account the type of information collected, whether the \r\ninformation is retained for any further use or purpose, the extent of the information, and the \r\nsecurity of the data systems that contain the information. In considering whether the individual \r\ninformation being collected is “identifiable, sensitive information,” sponsors, sponsor-\r\ninvestigators, and other researchers should be aware of the evolving perspectives as to the \r\nidentifiability of the information collected. Given current technological capabilities, there is \r\nsome support for the position that the identity of an individual participating in certain types of \r\nresearch is relatively easy to determine even with limited de-identified data. Genomic data also \r\nare often considered to fall automatically into the category of identifiable, sensitive information.4 \r\nThere are various definitions of the phrase identifiable, sensitive information used by different \r\ngovernment agencies and for different purposes – not all necessarily applicable in this context \r\nbut which may be useful in an evaluation by the sponsors, sponsor-investigators, and other \r\nresearchers of whether certain information would fall within the statutory definition.5  A \r\n                                                 \r\n4 NIH considers research in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected or used, to include “research that \r\ninvolves the generation of individual level, human genomic data from biospecimens, or the use of such data, \r\nregardless of whether the data is recorded in such a manner that human subjects can be identified or the identity of \r\nthe human subjects can readily be ascertained. ”  (NIH, NOT-OD-17-109: Notice of Changes to NIH Policy for \r\nIssuing Certificates of Confidentiality, effective October 1, 2017). 5 Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Chief Information Officer.

An IRB review serves an important role in the \r\nprotection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects. If an IRB in reviewing research \r\ndetermines that particular data collected in a clinical trial are sufficiently sensitive to warrant \r\nrequesting a CoC, then it is within the purview of an IRB to request that a CoC be obtained in \r\norder to secure IRB approval.

IV. Request for Discretionary CoC From FDA \r\n \r\nPrior to submitting a request to FDA for issuance of a discretionary CoC, the potential requestor \r\nshould consider the following questions: \r\n Is the requestor involved in human subject research in which identifiable, sensitive \r\ninformation is collected?  Is the requestor a sponsor or sponsor-investigator or authorized representative (i.e., the \r\nindividual who takes responsibility for or initiates the clinical investigation)?  Does the human subject research, for which a discretionary CoC is being requested, \r\ninvolve the use or study of a product subject to FDA’s jurisdiction and subject to FDA’s \r\nregulatory authority?  Are the requestor’s research measures sufficient to protect the confidentiality of the \r\nidentifiable, sensitive information? 6 \r\n \r\nWe recommend that a request to FDA for the issuance of a discretionary CoC be made by those \r\nentities and individuals that can answer “yes” to all of these questions. A request for a \r\ndiscretionary CoC also should not be made if the human subject research is federally funded.7  \r\nWe also prefer that all requests for discretionary CoCs be submitted electronically as described \r\nin this section and with the information and assurances as detailed in this section. To make a request to FDA for a discretionary CoC, the requestor should determine the \r\nappropriate Center and submit the request, in the form of a letter (e.g., as a PDF attachment to \r\nthe email submission), through one of the following email addresses: \r\n \r\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at: CDER-CoC-\r\nRequests@fda.hhs.gov \r\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at: \r\nCBERBIMONotification@fda.hhs.gov  \r\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at: CDRH-CoC@fda.hhs.gov  \r\nCenter for Tobacco Products (CTP) at: CTP_RIHSC@fda.hhs.gov \r\n                                                 \r\n6  The amendments to section 301(d) of the PHS Act, signal Congressional support for enhanced privacy protections \r\nfor participants in research. FDA recommends that sponsors and investigators explore ways to further enhance their \r\nown privacy and confidentiality procedures. 7 As noted in Section II, CoCs for federally funded research are mandatory and outside the scope of this guidance. Mandatory CoCs for federally funded research are handled in a different manner than discretionary CoCs.",
